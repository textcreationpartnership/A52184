         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> do call it <hi>Liturgia,</hi> which in its own proper ſignification, ſignifies Miniſtery; but by Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation, or by way of Excellency, it is generally by them applyed to the Holy Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> whence the <hi>Maſſe</hi> and <hi>Liturgie</hi> are Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſignifying the ſame thing; So that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and for the thing in its ſelf, no Chriſtian Nation ſince Chriſt, until theſe our latter times was without it.</p>

Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have moſt diligently labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to find out ſome Additions, which have been made thereto, and in this they much glory, but indeed their glory is in vain; for Additions ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the thing in being, wherefore in that they alleage ſuch Additions even very neer to the Apoſtles, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> was then in being; and conſequently, that it was ever ſince the Apoſtles, who received it from our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Fourthly, it is ſaid in his laſt Supper, when he exerciſed the Function of his Prieſthood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech;</hi> following the propheſie of <hi>David;</hi> and therefore Fifthly it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33751:12"/>ſaid, conſiſting in an Oblation of Chriſt's Body and blood, under the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, as Chriſt himſelf in his laſt Supper did, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Diſciples do the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is ſaid for a perpetual memory of Chriſt's paſſion, which our Saviour then commanded, ſaying, <hi>do this in memory of me;</hi> that is as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>to ſhew the death of our Lord until he comes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this is the continual belief of the Church, brought unto us by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition, teſtified by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers and Councels.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33751:12"/>wonderful effects thereof; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſs. 22. c. 2. ſaith, it is one and the ſame Hoſt, and the ſame Offerer, now by the Miniſtery of the Prieſts, who offered himſelf on the Croſs, different only in manner of Offering the fruits of which incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Oblation are by this moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully received.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Are there no particular or proper effects of this Sacrifice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, as we may gather from the denominations, which a learned Lay-man has, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. who calls it <hi>Latrentical,</hi> in as much as it is referred to the worſhip and honour of God, and profeſſion of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream excellency and dominion over all Creatures: which a <hi>Lapide</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> explicates thus ſaying, One of the motives why Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the ſame Sacrifice of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> was, that the Church might have wherewith to worſhip God So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignly, and condignly, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually honour and adore him with <hi>Latria;</hi> that is, with worſhip due only to him for this Victim which is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33751:13"/>offered to God in the Sacrifice of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is commenſurate and equal to God himſelf; Chriſt who is both God and Man being this Victim: all our worſhip and honour being but little and vile in compariſon of God, Chriſt hath made himſelf a Victim in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that by it, as equal to God, we might equally worſhip God, and exhibite as much <hi>Latria,</hi> and honour as he himſelf is worthy of, and as much as he can of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ask of us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he calls it <hi>Euchariſtical,</hi> becauſe it is made in Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Thankſgiving for the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign benefit of our Lord's paſſion, which is the Fountain and Spring of all God's benefits to mankind; we poor Creatures had nothing to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God for all his innumerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, eſpecially for theſe great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of our Redemption; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt amongſt other graces of his infinite Clemency, hath left us a Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving exceeding all other Sacrifices, which alſo cannot but be acceptable to God
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33751:13"/>the Father, whence this Sacrifice take by way of Excellency the name of <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that is Thankſgiving; whence St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, how can greater thanks be given then by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, whom the faithful do offer in the Church in this Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſaith it is <hi>Impetratory;</hi> that is a Sacrifice whereby we may obtain whatſoever we ſhall ask or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if we make our Petitions as we ought. Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you,</hi> in this Sacrifice he hath not only taught us the true means to make our petitions, but alſo an aſſurance of obtaining what we ask; for the Father cannot deny what we ask in his Sons name, much leſs what we ask by his Son, who is offered here unto him; for as with him he hath given all things, with him he will refuſe us nothing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he terms it <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> for it makes God propitious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto us, for by it Gods wrath is appeaſed, and our Sins remitted. Whence a late Authour well ſaid, that it brings the firſt Grace and Remiſſion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33751:14"/>of mortal Sins, by way of impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, raiſing in us good motions, by which we may find grace in time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient if we concur thereto. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the ſame way it gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace, that is, thoſe who are in Sin, may receive the grace of Repentance, and thoſe who are in grace, may receive encreaſe thereof. Thirdly, it remits venial Sins. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it takes away, or remits pains due for our Sins. Fifthly, by way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration, we may obtain not only Spiritual graces, but alſo Temporal benefits, as converſion of Infidels, or Hereticks, or Sinners encreaſe of perfection, victories over our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes, we Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſick, for the fruits of the Earth, and of the Sea, and for the whole World; in fine, this Sacrifice is offered by the faithful in all neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in ſo much that in many places Chriſtians will not begin any work, Suit of Law, journey, or ſuch like, before they have offered the Holy Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> On all Sundays and Holy days by precept of the Church, for as our St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> ſayes, we ought on ſuch days to perſiſt in prayer, either mental or vocal, and we cannot do it better than in the Maſſe, which he proves by the precept of Sanctifying the Sabbath, and by the precept of worſhipping and honouring God; for no Chriſtians ought to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in only abſtaining from ſervile works, which is the Negative part of the precept, but the Affirmative part carries with it another obligation; for it ordains the Sanctification of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33751:15"/>Sunday which is Holy, and with ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of prayer and praiſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; whence St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayes, <hi>we ought to reſt from all earthly labour, and inſiſt in prayer, that if we have negligently ſpent the Six days, it may be expiated by prayer on the Sunday.</hi> St. <hi>Clement</hi> avers, <hi>that we can have no excuſe before God, if we do not come on Sundays to hear Sermons, Sacrifice of the</hi> Maſſe, <hi>and Communion.</hi> And the Counſel of <hi>Forejulienſe</hi> ſayes, <hi>that we ought firſt to abſtain from all Sin, and from all Terrene work, and to give our ſelves to nothing but prayer, and have recourſe to the Church with great Devotion of mind, with charity and love; to bleſs God the Father, and with all our hearts to praiſe him:</hi> whence the Church willing to provide for the good of Souls, hath determined this Act of hearing <hi>Maſſe,</hi> as being moſt proper for ſuch days, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for our Souls; for we can do nothing more pleaſing to God, nor wherein God is more delighted, and our prayers more aſſuredly heard.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it good to hear</hi> Maſſe <hi>daily?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33751:15"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes ſurely, for it is a manifeſt ſign of great indevotion to do only thoſe things which are commanded, precepts indeed were made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Sin, and may be performed out of a ſervile fear; but good Chriſtians muſt obſerve them out of a filial fear, which is an effect of love. The Child who only fears the Rod, is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome pleaſing to his Parents, at leaſt deſerves not their love; and not to hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> but on days of Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, argues great defect of the love of God, and want of true Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if we did reflect on the good we loſe in not hearing <hi>Maſſe,</hi> or on our ſpiritual neceſſities, we would be at leaſt as careful and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to crave help in them, as in our corporal neceſſities; nay of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities. If we feel any Ach, Dolour, Infirmity or Sickneſs, we are careful to have Plaiſters, Purgations, Section of veins, or whatever remedy is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; no labour, no induſtry, no diligence is ſpared, no procraſtination or delay is grateful; and is not our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33751:16"/>Soul (which is infinitely more to be eſteemed) in need of help at all times, not only on Sundays and Holy days, but in each day of the week. For though they were Saints, yet they have an Emulation of greater vertue, and progreſs in perfection. But alas we are ſinners and feel the burthen of our Sins; our Souls are ſick and infirm through the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of out Nature, not only prone to ſin, but are actually infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, none are without ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we ſtand in need of help daily and hourly; have we not then great reaſon to go more frequently to this health-giving Sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as is ſaid before, we may be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cleanſed and ſpiritually cured.</p>
                  <p>Again, if there were great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Riches to be had in any place for all thoſe who ſhould come and take them, would any forbear to run to that place? ſure they would make no delays, ſpare no labour, take no reſt, nothing could hinder them. Now in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> there is a Treaſure of ſpiritual Riches, or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33751:16"/>Heavenly Benedictions and Celeſtial gifts, more to be valued than the whole World, and all its Gold and Silver; what ſtupidity then is it to neglect, what we may ſo eaſily by the mercy of God obtain?</p>
                  <p>In fine, do we not daily want mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace, or the encreaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? let us hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> daily, both are there to be had: are we grateful to God? as we receive benefits daily, ſo let us thank God daily, and we cannot do it in a better place. Do we want any thing either in Spirit or in body? the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is the ſure means to obtain it; our wants are <hi>quotidian,</hi> it is convenient to ſeek a <hi>quotidian</hi> help and remedy.</p>
                  <p>Although our Holy Mother the Church doth not command it, yet ſhe plainly and piouſly invites us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ordaining that <hi>Maſſe</hi> ſhould be ſaid daily, that all good Chriſtians might be preſent thereat, and praiſe God with the Prieſts, the Church doors are open, the Prieſts attend you at the appointed hour, the Bells ring to awaken and call us thereto;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33751:17"/>
                     <hi>Honorius</hi> well ſaid, the Church reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the Sacrament or Sacrifice daily, that thoſe who labour in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard may be refreſhed daily.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. ſayes, before Chriſt was to depart out of this World to his Father, he made this Supper, wherein he poured forth the Riches of his Divine love towards us; which St. <hi>Bernard</hi> termeth <hi>love of loves, love which is truly love, love drawing love, love exceeding all love;</hi> and our St. <hi>Bernardine, Furnace of love;</hi> and in another place he cries out, <hi>O how viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous is the charity of Chriſt? O ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of his heart! O admirable immenſitie of ſo great love! O incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible latitude of ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: he would be inflamed with ſo great ardour of love towards our little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to beſtow on us ſo abundantly his fleſh for meat; and his blood for drink, as if it did not ſuffice our amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Jeſus, for the ſhewing of his ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brited love, that he did once really ſhed his ſacred blood on the Croſs, unleſs he ſhould pour it out for us in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33751:17"/>Now I believe there is no good Chriſtian ſo tepid and cold, but would with all his heart, he had been preſent there; and doth not our faith teach us that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is the ſame with Chriſt's Supper, which Chriſt himſelf continues in the Church, and ſo will do to the end of the World; he himſelf is preſent, he himſelf is the principal cauſe of the Holy action, and here he gives the ſame, which he gave then: there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference but in the viſibility of the one, and the inviſibility in the other; Faith which ought to command and rule both ſenſe and reaſon, tells us it is ſo. Good God! how is it poſſible that any Chriſtian can neglect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond in ſome way to this great love, which is actually every where offered and preſented unto us in the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe?</hi> he comes daily to ſeek us, and ſhall we think much to go to him daily?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>My Soul is much comforted in what you have ſaid, and I will endeavour to apply my mind to this conſideration henceforward; but if you pleaſe have we no other cauſe of Devotion?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We read in the Evangeliſts, that many Women did follow Jeſus to ſee his paſſion, and all his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſtood by his Mother and two <hi>Maryes,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> out of their tender love to their Maſter; Our Faith alſo teaches that this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is a renewing of Chriſt's paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our memory; nay, (as hath been ſaid before) it is the ſame with the Sacrifice of the Croſs, and is made in the remembrance of Chriſt's death and paſſion; ſhall then our ſenſes be more prevalent than our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enlightned by Faith, which teaches us that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the ſame paſſion unto the end of the World; wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> in the ſame manner as if we were preſent at the Croſs, and beholding our Saviour ſuffering thereon, the rather becauſe thereby the effects of the paſſion are applyed to us.</p>
                  <p>I will end this Subject with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of St. <hi>William,</hi> ſometimes Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Burgos,</hi> who being preſent at <hi>Maſſe,</hi> was ſo devout, that Tears did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33751:18"/>flow from his eyes, as waters from Fountains; and being asked the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, he anſwered, becauſe when I think that Jeſus Chriſt Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices himſelf every day; I have no leſs Dolour or Sorrow then if I did ſee him immolated on Mount <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> certainly on this conſideration any devout heart would have a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſt's paſſion, which is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented in all the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> as in the ſecond part will more amply ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What other Conſideration will you give me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All Hiſtories do teſtifie the great Devotion of the primitive times, how fervent the Chriſtians were to Communicate daily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to hear <hi>Maſſe;</hi> and when they could not, they carried the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament to their houles, and this principally in time of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> gives the reaſon, for ſaith he, <hi>Devout Souls do return from this Table (that is from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the</hi> Maſſe) <hi>as it were breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33751:19"/>fire, become terrible to the Devils.</hi> And <hi>St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>he cannot be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Martyrdom, who is not armed by the Church:</hi> The mind fails which is not raiſed up and inflamed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who are in places of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought more frequently to receive the holy Sacrament, and at leaſt hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> daily, that ſo they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared againſt their Enemies, and be the better diſpoſed to ſuffer for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Have you no examples for this hearing of</hi> Maſſe <hi>daily?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teſtifies, that his Mother did hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> daily. Our St. <hi>Anſelm</hi> when through old age he could not ſay <hi>Maſſe,</hi> daily heard it. St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> knowing the vertue thereof, was wont even in his deepeſt ſtudies to ſay <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and to hear another, and oftentimes did ſerve thereat. And St. <hi>Weneſellaus,</hi> Duke or King of <hi>Poland,</hi> on whoſe day I write this, did every day hear <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and many times did ſerve the Prieſt therein. But what do I go to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33751:19"/>forreign examples, our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third was ſo devout in this kind, that <hi>Fox</hi> ſayes of him, that he ſpent his days in hearing of <hi>Maſſe.</hi> And Biſhop <hi>Smith</hi> in his <hi>Flores</hi> cites many Authours, affirming that he was wont to hear Three high <hi>Maſſes</hi> every day. The anſwer that he made to King <hi>Lewis</hi> is remarkable, for when the Holy King ſaid that he ought not to apply himſelf alwayes to hearing of <hi>Maſſes,</hi> but ſometimes to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: he anſwered, that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee a friend oftentimes, then hear another ſpeak of him. The ſame St. <hi>Lewis</hi> affirmed, that Pſalms and <hi>Maſſe</hi> would deliver from all dangers and ſhame; to this we may add the great Devotion of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who notwithſtanding that his Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, yet being at <hi>Maſſe</hi> he would not depart until the <hi>Maſſe</hi> was ended: and thereby, as it is believed he gained a ſignal Victory.</p>
                  <p>But what do I ſtand to relate ſuch examples known to all who read the lives of Saints, ſcarce any Saint or Devout perſons have been defective
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33751:20"/>in this kind of Exerciſe; and ſuch is the practiſe of almoſt all Catholick Countries, where not only the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Miſtreſſes with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but ſervants, alſo labourers and Travellers for the moſt part do hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> every day. Memorable is the example of bleſſed <hi>Raymond</hi> a Dominican Fryar, who was wont to ſay, <hi>I cannot rejoyce or take comfort that day wherein I am forced not to ſay</hi> Maſſe; Devout perſons will find the ſame effect in their Souls, if at any time they be barred or hindred from hearing <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Imitable is the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. <hi>Elzear</hi> Count of <hi>Arian</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who amongſt other of his precepts given to his Family, in the firſt place ſaith, <hi>I command that all thoſe of my Family be preſent every day at the Holy Sacrifice of the</hi> Maſſe; <hi>for as long as God is ſerved by me, I fear not, that any thing will be wanting to me.</hi> The like care we may read in the life of that famous <hi>D'Rentes,</hi> and what is more, the Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders even in the Field, are careful that their Souldiers hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> daily.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33751:21"/>ſolid, and grounded upon better motives; yet according to the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, we come ſhort of the fervour uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels:</hi> for if we remember, in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall find that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did exceed us in exteriour Devotion, Reverence and Worſhip during the time of their Sacrifices, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs were but figures of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And in a book of the <hi>Ottaman</hi> Empire ſet out not long ago, we read, that the <hi>Turks</hi> in their prayers, do perform that action with very much Reverence and Devotion, and hold that they ought to be ſo intent, and freed in their thoughts, on this Religious act towards God; that no buſineſs of the World, though the execution of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s decree, ſhould at the ſame time be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; or fire ſhould burſt forth in the very Chamber where they remain; or an armed Enemie within their Gates or Camp; ought not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or break off abruptly their prayers; to extinguiſh or oppoſe themſelves againſt their inevitable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33751:21"/>deſtruction; It is much that <hi>Infidels</hi> ſhould be poſſeſſed with ſuch exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive awe and fear of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the time of their prayers. And we Chriſtians be ſo eaſily diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in time of ſo great a Sacrifice, and upon ſlight occaſions with-draw our ſelves from it, to the great diſtraction and diſ-edification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others.</p>
                  <p>It is reported that the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> although aged, do never ſit in the Church, but out of Reverence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kneel, or ſtand leaning on their Staves. Memorable is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who would never enter into the Church to hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> with his Arms or Crown, but left them at the door; alleaging that ſuch Reverence ought to be given to ſuch places, wherein the divine Majeſty of God did more eſpecially ſhine. St. <hi>Martin</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf in the Church with ſo great Reverence and Devotion, that he was never ſeen to ſit there, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to kneel or ſtand with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and pale fear, being demanded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33751:22"/>the cauſe thereof, he anſwered, ſhall I not fear and tremble, knowing that I ſtand before God. St. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> relates of his Mother, that her veneration to the Churches was ſo great, that her voice was never heard therein; but in ſilence ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Holy Myſteries, and that ſhe never turned her back to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, nor ever ſpit in thoſe divine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What ſay the Holy Fathers of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I will only cite ſome few, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> firſt occurs, who in one of his Sermons ſayes, <hi>Let our entry into the Churches be humble and devout, let our abode in them, be quiet and acceptable before God, pleaſing to the beholders, which may not only edifie the ſtanders by, but alſo encourage them; let us attend in thoſe places to the ſacred Solemnities with intent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and inſiſt in devout prayers; let all vain things ceaſe, much more filthy and prophane; a way with all talk and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabulations. Woe, woe to the impudence of men, for they are confounded with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33751:22"/>greater ſhame before men, than before God; for we are bold to do many things in the ſight of God, which we would be aſhamed to do before men.</hi> This he learned of his and our Seraphical Father St. <hi>Francis,</hi> whoſe words are, <hi>It is a great miſery and miſerable infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that we ſhould regard any thing in this World, when we have God ſo preſent. The whole man may dread, the World tremble, and Heaven rejoyce, when Chriſt the Son of the living God is on the Altar in the hands of the Prieſt; O admirable altitude! O ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious favour! O humble ſublinity, the Lord our God, and the Son of God ſo humbles himſelf, that for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hides himſelf under the little form of Bread: Behold O Brethren God's Humility, and pour forth your hearts before him, and be ye humbled, that ſo you may be exalted by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Rule which amongſt others St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives, <hi>Nothing at all ought to be done in the Oratory, Chappel or Church, beſides the Worſhip of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſinging, that our works and mind continually employed may be agreeable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33751:23"/>to the name of Oratories or place of prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will conclude with the words of St. <hi>Nilus,</hi> who with St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle in his Liturgie, and St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> very frequently, St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril</hi> affirms that the Angels are there preſent with fear and trembling; he concludes, <hi>I write theſe things that underſtanding of what dread the Divine Majeſty is: ye do not remiſly neglect the fear of our Lord, nor permit any others to talk or mutter, in the time of the Oblation, that is the</hi> Maſſe, <hi>nor raſhly harken or be moved from becoming gravity, or to go up and down with idle and divided divagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

                  <head>Of Intention.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it neceſſary to have an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hear</hi> Maſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There are ſome who go to hear <hi>Maſſe</hi> following their fancies, with little or nothing of a rational action, for they little conſider, why, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or for what end they come to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33751:23"/>
                     <hi>Maſſe:</hi> but do as they ſee others do, or like ſheep one follows the other; or out of Cuſtome, no way reflecting on the ſpiritual operation, neceſſary to ſuch ſpiritual and ſupernatural myſteries. Whereas man who is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, ought to work rationally with reaſon and prudence; and firſt propound the true end of what he is to do, directing his intentions thereto, and then to conſider propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate means to attain that end, and accordingly to frame his actions. The firſt thing therefore required is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence all humane actions have their value or worth, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>The intention therefore leads and governs the mind and underſtanding, whence St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> ſaid well, <hi>The intention illuminates the knowledge of good works, low and mean works done in ſpirit and right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, become valuable and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> but the beſt works loſe their value and eſteem, where juſt and good intentions are wanting: would we have God to receive that which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33751:24"/>we do not offer: or can we expect to obtain what we never intended to ask? ſuch prayers are rather babling, and at the beſt are but abuſively cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led prayers: and therefore it is no wonder, if they be ineffectual; for ſurely God is not <hi>vocis ſed cordis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor.</hi> It is the devotion and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart, which makes our prayer pleaſing to God, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mellifluous,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> will give us a notable pattern to this our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſaying, <hi>Come Intentions, Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Wills and Affections, all my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour parts; let us aſcend to the Mountain,</hi> (That is to the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> or to the Church) <hi>where our Lord ſees, and is ſeen: yee cares, Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, Anxieties, Dolours, Services, expect me here</hi> (that is at the door of the Church) <hi>with the Aſs my body, whilſt I with the Boy,</hi> that is, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding, <hi>haſtning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after we have Adored we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto you, for we will return:</hi> and alas, how quickly ſhall we return. When we go to <hi>Maſſe,</hi> we ought to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33751:24"/>lay aſide all other thoughts, and bend all our intentions to what we are then to do.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many wayes may one make his Intentions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The intention may have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our actions actually, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, or habitually. Then our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are actual, when by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the mind, we actually intend ſuch or ſuch an end of our actions. Then virtually, when having made firſt an actual intention, we do ſuch or ſuch actions in conformity, or in vertue of ſuch a precedent actual intention. Then habitually, when being accuſtomed to ſuch and ſuch actions, which import ſuch or ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, we do them without refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on them. For example, when I actually intend to go or hear <hi>Maſſe,</hi> then my intention is actual; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to hear it for ſuch and ſuch ends, or for remiſſion of my Sins, for to obtain grace and ſuch like. And when I do what becomes a Chriſtian by vertue of my precedent intention there is a virtual influence on what, I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33751:25"/>do, although I do not reflect upon any ſuch intention. An example of the third, may be of him who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to give Alms, not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring actually what he doth at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; who nevertheleſs would not give it but for God; ſuch a one may be ſaid to have a habitual intention.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, to wit actual intention, as it importeth a continual intention to the end, is proper only to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſuch who have obtained that ſpecial grace of God, who by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abſtraction from all earthly things, are abſorpt in God: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, by diligence, we may at leaſt frequently renew thoſe actual inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, provided that it be not done with anxiety or trouble of mind, to the hindrance of the action we are to do.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, that is, virtual inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuffices to make our actions plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable to God, merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and profitable to our Souls, and in this none can pretend difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for what is more eaſie then to make ſome actual intention, either
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33751:25"/>before they go from their Houſes, or when they are in the Church, or at the beginning of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> to hear it for ſuch ends as they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to themſelves, ſo to prepare themſelves for ſo Holy an action; now the intention ſo made virtually, accompanies the whole action; and unleſs ſome contrary intentions inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, makes the whole action ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and meritorious in ſuch ſort, that although we have many diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, coldneſs of Devotion, want of fervour or ſuch like, the action ſo done loſes not its merit or effect.</p>
                  <p>The third, that is habitual intention, is or ought to be common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who in vertue of their Baptiſm and Faith, may be ſaid to intend all that becomes a Chriſtian; and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things may be ſaid to have an habitual intention, which all have in ſome degree, who do not their actions for ſome other end, as for humane praiſe or glory, or ſuch like. In ſo doing they do a work which is good in it ſelf, if not vitiated other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though I cannot ſay vertuous, as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33751:26"/>they are done by them, yet the action of hearing <hi>Maſſe</hi> may be profitable, if not for their own ſakes, by the prayers and merits of others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the prayers which the prieſt hath in particular for all there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as in place convenient ſhall be declared, and alſo offers the Holy Sacrifice for them.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The wiſe man gives us this Counſel: <hi>Before prayer prepare thy Soul,</hi> to wit with good intentions and deſires, <hi>and be not as a man that tempts God.</hi> He tempts God, who when he prayes, or does a work that is good in it ſelf, attends not to what he does; as ſuch who ſpeak or make prayer to God, and have their mind on other things. And therefore in another place the ſame wiſe man adviſes us <hi>to take heed of our ſelves, and attend diligently to our hearing,</hi> that is, to what we are doing. And <hi>Solomon</hi> gives this caution, <hi>when thou doeſt ſit down to eat with a Prince, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend diligently what things are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy face, and ſet a knife in thy throat;</hi> which in a myſtical ſenſe, we may apply to our purpoſe, for when we come to <hi>Maſſe</hi> we come to the Princes Table, where we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, firſt to conſider whoſe Table it is, and our Faith teaches us, that it is the Table of God, which is full of Majeſty and power, in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the Angels do tremble; it is he who invites us, he honours us with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33751:27"/>his preſence, and the Altar is his Table. Secondly, we may and ought to attend diligently to the things ſet before us, the actions of the Prieſts, the Rites, Ceremonies, Myſteries and prayers, which the Church has ordained for the honour of ſo great a Prince. Thirdly, we ought to have the Sword of Fear alwayes in all our actions, words, geſture, and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; that we neither think, ſpeak, or do any thing there which beſeems not to be done before ſo great a God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhall we do this?</hi>

I know many find difficulty herein, but may we not be aſhamed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33751:27"/>to be ſo attentive, vigilant &amp; reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a temporal Prince, and ſay we cannot do as much to the King of Kings; we can be Three hours atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a Play, or ſome Poppet ſhew, or ſuch like, and we cannot attend one half hour to the Heavenly My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; we can ſeriouſly attend to a ſtory, to ſports and games whole nights, but to give attentive mind to this ſacred Oblation, every little time is too much, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I ſuppoſe this matter not to concern any matter of Faith, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the Government of the Church, which in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was determined, as ſoon as any queſtion was made of it; for in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent times, I mean before theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hereticks, all antiquity did agree in this, that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> in the <hi>Oriental</hi> parts was ſaid <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and in the Weſtern parts was alwayes ſaid in <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſo in <hi>England</hi> from the beginning of its converſion; and no <hi>Liturgies</hi> or <hi>Maſſes</hi> was ever in the vulgar Language; wherefore it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only to ſhew here the grounds thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now as there is one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptiſm; ſo there is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33751:29"/>one Church, and one Sacrifice: and this one Church, in as much as may be, ſpeaks the ſame Tongue; that as our hearts are united in the ſame Faith, ſo our devotions to the ſame Sacrifice ought to agree in thoſe Tongues, which are not ſubject to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations and changes, as vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are: wherefore the Church hath thought fit to have this divine Sacrifice to be celebrated in <hi>Latin,</hi> which uncorruptedly, and without alteration paſſes throughout the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern parts, as common to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof; So that in diverſity of Countreys, ſtill there remains the ſame form of <hi>Maſſe</hi> equally intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to all, and thereby any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in all Countreys finds the ſame Sacrifice, and underſtands it as well in one Countrey as in another: and certainly there is no exteriour thing, that ſo much agrees to the Unity of the Church, and Conformity to the divine Service, and the Prieſts in all Countreys whereſoever they go, may ſerve God in this Sacrifice, agreeably to thoſe of every place where he comes.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:33751:29"/>
                  <p>Moreover, we muſt know that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is a Sacrifice, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, and none are to offer this Sacrifice but Prieſts, it is their Office and Function only, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate <hi>Maſſe</hi> for the faithful; the Church even from the Apoſtles times has ordained Six other Orders for the Prieſt's aſſiſtance therein, and none by Office is to intervene therein; all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the primitive times were excluded from the Quire, and have nothing to do therein, but ſilently to offer up their prayers, votes, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and deſires, with the Prieſt in the ſame manner as in the old Law. The High Prieſt only did enter into the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi> and none but Prieſts and Levites did enter into the places for Sacrifice; which St. <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 1. teſtifies, ſaying, <hi>That when</hi> Zacharias <hi>entred the Temple of our Lord, all the multitude of the People, was praying without at the hour of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe:</hi> loe here the People were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without, which is deſcribed by the wiſe man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 50. where having declared the Office of the Prieſts and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33751:30"/>their Oblation, he ſayes: <hi>Then all the People together made haſt, and fel on their faces upon the Earth to adore our Lord their God, and to make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God omnipotent the Higheſt.</hi> It was then the Office of Prieſts to offer Sacrifice; and the duty of the People, was to pray and adore their God; it ſufficed them to ſee the ſmoak of the Incenſe, whereby they knew that the Prieſts was offering Sacrifice for them, and with proſtrations and genuflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they joyned their prayers with the Prieſt, believing by a lively Faith, and firm Hope, that the Sacrifice was acceptable to God, and profitable to themſelves. All which did prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the holy Sacrifice of the Altar; wherein Chriſtians regard not ſo much the words, as the action; nor the voice, but the vow. Here all are, or ought to be employed in fervent affections, and contemplation of the divine Myſteries, and by their vows of heart, or in their prayers, unite themſelves to the Prieſt in his actions of the Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the People come not for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33751:30"/>Inſtruction, they come not to Sacrifice, which is not their Office; they come not preciſely to pray, for that they may do at home, or in the Church at all times; but they come here to be partakers of the Prieſt's prayers, and oblation of the Sacrifice; it nothing imports them whether it be done in this or that Language, no more then it imports to a Countreyman to have his Petition offered to his Prince in this or that Language; the only thing he requires is the grant of his Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I believe he is as earneſt for his Suit, as if it were done in his own Language. It ſuffices then for the People, that they believe the Prieſt according to his Function, and exteriour actions, in offering the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for them, and endeavour to concur with him as I ſaid before; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the underſtanding of the words avails little, unleſs the affection of the mind ſecond it; the words ſerve but to move the ſenſes, and by them the underſtandieg: if then the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be well informed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, as all good Chriſtians are or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33751:31"/>ought to be in the knowledge of the Myſteries, nothing more is required, but a correſpondency of the will to that Dictamen.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Are there not certain means to help the attention at</hi> Maſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Love or fear would eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce motives of attention; a man that hath a Suit in any Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is very attentive, although his cauſe be pleaded in another Language; for during his Plea he is anxious of the ſucceſs; ſometimes fears his cauſe may fall; ſometimes hopes he may obtain what he deſires; now regards his Advocate, then beholds the Judges, if by any ſign he may note their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, in fine, he thinks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe during the whole time. In like manner the devout Soul who hath made his Intentions to hear <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for ſomething which he deſires, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to what the Prieſt offers for him, and with correſpondent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, does follow him in the whole courſe of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> If any one will truſt to experience, let him go to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Aſſemblies, and he ſhall plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33751:31"/>ſee that <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> did build Churches, and our Father pull'd them down. So the Devotion of the Catholick People in their Latin <hi>Maſſe,</hi> will in all reſpects ſurpaſs that of thoſe who frequent the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented vulgar Service, and that with a great deal of reaſon, for that they ſerve God in a more noble way, to wit, in a Sacrifice Inſtituted by Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the Church ordains ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ceremonies, in the whole courſe of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> to move and continue our Attention, as in the ſecond part ſhall be more particularly declared in general; She invites us in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a mutual confeſſion, and frequently with an <hi>Oremus,</hi> let us pray: in like manner with a <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> our Lord be with you: it is convenient that you attend to him. Finally, all along the <hi>Maſſe</hi> by the Ceremonies ſhe puts us in mind of Chriſt in his Nativity, laſt Supper, Paſſion, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion; which if we obſerve, it will be hard to find any other thoughts.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By Ceremonies, nothing elſe is underſtood, but external Religious ſigns, or actions, teſtifying or moving the internal Worſhip, Service or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which we give, or ought to give to God; and imports no more then the manner of God's exteriour Worſhip, or what may conduce thereto, either by external actions, ſigns, ſutable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and motives which ſerve for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Devotion, Reverence and reſpect in our minds to God, and to the things which belong to him; which ought to be accompanied with affection of the mind: and therefore are called ſigns, in as much as they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33751:32"/>ſignifie or manifeſt, that which is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in order to the due Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ceremonies, are otherwiſe called Rites, in as much as they are approved by the Cuſtome and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Ordinance of the Church, in the Adminiſtration of Sacred things, and therefore require a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obſervance; their end being nothing elſe but God's honour, to put us in mind of our Duty to him, and keep a devout obſervance in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; ſo that we may ſay the uſe of Ceremonies belonging to Religion, which is a vertue whoſe proper act is to Worſhip God, as well by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Submiſſion and Reverence, by Faith, Hope and Charity, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal actions to the ſame end, as Adorations, Victims, Sacrifices, Tithes, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Were Ceremonies alwayes uſed in the Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes certainly; for there cannot be any external or outward Worſhip of God, nor Aſſociation of men in Religion, without Ceremonies, Rites
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33751:33"/>and Forms of ſerving God: nay thoſe extern ſigns, in order to the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Homage to the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, ſeem to be conſonant to the Law of Nature, practiſed in all Ages, and Laws; yea our Saviour himſelf, and his Apoſtles, did practiſe them, and the Church in all times ſince has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Can you give any reaſon for them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We are humane, and as ſuch, we have a Soul and a Body, the one works not without the other, for there is a mutual dependence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; the will cannot have its operation, but by the Miniſtery of the underſtanding; nor the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding without the Senſes, ſome way or other the operations of the Soul united to the Body, depend on the Senſes, and the Senſes on ſenſible objects; hence the Holy Counſel of <hi>Trent</hi> gives the reaſon, why, our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mother the Church doth uſe theſe Rites and Ceremonies, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man; which cannot be raiſed to the meditation of Divine things; but by exteriour ſupports, and helps;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33751:33"/>and declares the principal end of ſuch Ceremonies, which are uſed in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> to wit, for the ſetting forth the Majeſty of ſo great a Sacrifice; and that the minds of the faithful by thoſe viſible ſigns of Religion, and Piety, may be moved to the contemplation of thoſe moſt high things, or Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, contained in this Sacrifice; for by things ſeen or received in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we are moved, and handed to the comprehenſion of the ſpiritual things.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>Deſcending into particulars, I pray what is Adoration?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Divines diſtinguiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween internal and external Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God; the internal conſiſts in the acknowledgement or mental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his ſupreme Dominion; which a rational Creature makes to God; out of a ſubmiſſive and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent affection: The external conſiſts in the exhibition of exteriour ſigns,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33751:34"/>whereby a rational Creature profeſſes the inward eſteem of God's Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with all ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe ſigns, ſome are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolely pertaining to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, no way applyable to others, as Sacrifices, Churches, Altars and ſuch like, belonging to Sacrifice. There are others which have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in themſelves, either to God or to Creatures, without any diſtinction of the ſign; but in as much, as they have reference to different Excellencies, of which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, much is taken from the Divine Worſhip, and thruſt into humane Honours, either by exceſſive Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or peſtilent Flattery; yet ſtill with a reſerved notice, that they are Men held worthy indeed of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Honour, or at moſt of Adoration; for even Men in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures have a kind of Reverend Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration allowed them.</p>
                  <p>Now although this Excellency is different, according to the ſeveral perfections: yet we may reduce them to Three heads. Increate or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33751:34"/>which is found only in God, the other is Create, which is in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and is Twofold; the firſt, is ſuch that hath a reſemblance to God, in ſome perfection of Sanctity: the ſecond, is in reſpect of ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dignity or Worth eſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men. According to theſe Three Excellencies, we may diſtinguiſh a threefold Adoration, Worſhip or Honour; which for want of proper names, we ſhall deſcribe by theſe notions; Divine, Religious, and Civil. By Divine, I underſtand, that which is proper only to God, called by St. <hi>Auguſtine Latria,</hi> and this is properly Adoration; yet not as to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the external Action, no more than love or fear, which in all external ſhew, cannot be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the very ſame may be done to Creatures, and many times Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically and feignedly.</p>
                  <p>By Religious Worſhip or Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I underſtand that which is given to Creatures, by reaſon of their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, or ſome ſpiritual perfection; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> Adored to the ground
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33751:35"/>the Angels, <hi>Balaam,</hi> and alſo <hi>Joſue</hi> did the like, which alſo the Angel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; <hi>Tobias</hi> and his Son Adored on their knees, when they knew it was an Angel; in like manner <hi>Saul</hi> Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Abdias</hi> before <hi>Elias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By Civil Worſhip, I mean that which is given to Earthly Men, by reaſon of their Dignity, Office or Quality: So <hi>Abraham</hi> Adored the People of the Land; and the People Adored the King; <hi>Jacob</hi> Adored his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brothers Adored him; <hi>Ruth, Boos; Abigail, David; Judith, Holofernes;</hi> and <hi>Achior, Judith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not therefore oppoſite to the Commandment of Honouring and Adoring God; to give a civil Honour to Men of Authority; or Religious Honour to perſons or things which appertain to God: but to give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Soveraign Honour, which is only due to God: to any thing that is not God, is a breach of the precept, and plain Idolatry: we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded-otherwiſe to Honour our King and our Parents.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:33751:35"/>
                  <p>Q <hi>May not the ſimple People, who underſtand not this diſtinction, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived therein?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Can any one think, that there is any Chriſtian, who hath his Senſes about him, and believes there are no more Gods then one; as they are Taught as well by their Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as by the common Catechiſms, whereby they know him to be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and Creator of all things, can give his Honour to any Creature whatſoever; therefore they give Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to our Bleſſed Lady, or the Saints, or Holy things; although they uſe the ſame exteriour ſigns, yet they give not the ſame Honour, which they know they are to give to God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Proſtration, and when is it uſed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This Proſtration is a caſting the whole Body on the ground, and is not now ſo much uſed, as in former times; eſpecially by Penitents in the time of publick Pennance; but it is practiſed even in theſe our times, by ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, eſpecially the <hi>Carthuſians;</hi> before they begin <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33751:36"/>uſed in the Church on <hi>Good Fryday,</hi> and on the Eves of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> and privately by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Devout perſons: for it ſignifies a total Submiſſion of the whole Man to God; and carries with it an humble acknowledgement of our own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or a total confidence in God's Goodneſs and Mercy. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>he that humbles himſelf as to kneel, hath yet a way how to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more: but he that humbles himſelf to caſt his whole Body to the Earth, can humble himſelf no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have examples of this in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who in the time of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and times of neceſſity, did uſe it, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Judith,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi> and others; ſometimes by way of Humiliation, as <hi>Abraham, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as alſo <hi>Joſue;</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of Adoration, as <hi>Salomon,</hi> the Prieſts, and the whole multitude; the like is to be ſeen in <hi>Eſdreas</hi> and <hi>Tobias.</hi> So the <hi>Leper,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>did magnifie God, and fell on his face before Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Mary Magdalene:</hi> but above all examples, that of our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33751:36"/>Saviour proſtrating himſelf in the Garden.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What ſay you of Genuflection or kneeling?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This much depends upon Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, however kneeling in time of Prayer is very ancient; for we read of it in the Old Teſtament, and it was practiſed by the Apoſtles; yea by our Saviour himſelf. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſayes, that praying on the knees was the uſual poſture of Chriſtians, and ſometimes they did caſt themſelves proſtrate on the Earth. It is reported of the Apoſtle St. <hi>James,</hi> that by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and long <hi>Genuflection</hi> his knees were as hard as a <hi>Camels</hi> skin.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Genuflection</hi> carries with it a confeſſion of our Infirmity, and teſtifies our ſubmiſſion to God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the interiour humility of our Heart; and although Proſtration may ſeem to be a greater ſign of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, yet for this action of hearing <hi>Maſſe,</hi> the kneeling is more proper, becauſe we are to attend to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries there repreſented; whence it is the common Cuſtome at <hi>Maſſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:33751:37"/>that all good Catholicks do kneel.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What ſay you of Station or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church ordains ſtanding to all at the Goſpel and Creed in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and that with great reaſon; for the poſture of ſtanding is proper for Conſideration, and Attention; as he that ſtands, ſees further, ſo the Soul in this poſture, conſiders more attentively, and is more prompt and elevated, by a more vehement appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the ſtanding alſo ſhews Promptitude in the Hearing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of what is declared, as is the proper Poſture of our Miniſters; whence the Prieſt as being in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Action at his Miniſtery, ſtands for the moſt part of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he could not perform the Rites and Ceremonies; the nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice requires it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What of Inclination or Bowing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The wiſe Man gives this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>To the ancient, humble thy Soul; and to a great Man, bow thy Head;</hi> as a Token of Reverence, and ſign of Humility and Submiſſion. But none
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33751:37"/>more properly uſed this Ceremony, than Chriſt himſelf; who bowing or inclining his Head, gave up the Ghoſt: to ſhew his Humility and Reverence to the Father. This the Church uſed many times in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and with inclination we reverence the Altar, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Holy things, as a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the reſpect we bear to them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the Poſture of our Hands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In this we may conſider, that ſometimes the Prieſt joyns his Hands, and ſometimes opens them again. Now, in Prayer to joyn our Hands, is a fitting Poſture, of one who makes Supplication, and Petition; for we in Prayer, make Supplication to God for Mercy, and humble Petition for his Grace and benefits; and by directing our Hands to Heaven, we manifeſt that our hope is only in God; and in joyning our Hands alſo, we make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that we are able to do nothing of ourſelves; and as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſay, <hi>by this Poſture we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the merits of Chriſt, acknowledging
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33751:38"/>our ſelves altogether unable to do, and unworthy to deſerve any good:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this humble manner, we offer up Chriſt's merits to God the Father, as a moſt efficacious means to obtain what we deſire. Briefly, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we deſire. Briefly, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we preſent our ſelves as Captives, or as labouring with extreme want and neceſſity. Now the Hands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, do repreſent the extenſion of our Saviour's Hands on the Croſs, and is a fitting poſture for the Prieſt, who in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> repreſents Chriſt's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>It may alſo ſignifie the elevation of the mind to God, and ſhews a deſire to have the Heart go with the Hands, as laid open to dart Lances of love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court of Heaven, or to receive the influence of God's Grace. We have a fitting Embleme of this, in the example of one, who being like to be drowned, ſtretched forth his Hands to catch hold of any thing for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: even ſo do we poor Sinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in danger to be drowned in Sin and iniquity, ſtretch forth our Hands, and with them the affection of our Hearts,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33751:38"/>and knowing that there is no help in Earth, or Earthly things, we ſtretch out our hands to Heaven, from whence we expect Relief; ſaying with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Let us lift up our Hearts with our hands to Heaven.</hi> I will conclude with the words of St. <hi>Cyprian, The pious Prieſt, whom the Holy Ghoſt ſtirs up, moves and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; repreſenting the Myſtery of the Croſs, by the Elevation of his hands, prayes for his own and the Peoples Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the lifting up of the eyes to Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Whenſoever the Prieſt joyns his hands, or ſhuts them, for the moſt part he lifts up his eyes to Heaven, and this congruouſly; for nature teaches us, that the eye followeth the Heart; and it is a common ſaying; <hi>where love is, there the eye is;</hi> there is no ſenſe more betrayes our interiour Affections, and Paſſions. The lifting up then of the eyes, repreſents the intention of the mind or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the affection of the Heart or will; of this we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples in the Scripture, in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33751:39"/>
                     <hi>Sarah, Tobias</hi> his Wife, and King <hi>David,</hi> who often mentions it in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> but principally in the actions of our Saviour.</p>

                  <p>Such alſo hath been the Tradition, Practiſe and Cuſtome of the Jews, who hold this name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> highly to be Worſhiped, eſteeming it as the Primary and Eſſential name of God; becauſe it did ſignifie his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, Eſſence and incomprehenſible Majeſty, wherefore they did bear ſo great Reverence and Honour to that Name, that if in Reading of the Scripture, or otherwiſe, they did find it; they would not utter it in voice, but conceive it in mind, judging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy to pronounce that Holy Name; and when the High Prieſt did pronounce it, they all Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and bowed down; and out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Reverence thereto, the High Prieſt did bear the Holy name engraven on his Mitre, and theſe were then God's choſen People, wherefore none did reprove them or condemn them. The ſequel of the Major is clear, for we Chriſtians have as much, if not more reaſon, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33751:40"/>the name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For as <hi>Abulenſis</hi> juſtly infers, <hi>the name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>is more Holy and more Excellent.</hi> And as St. Paul ſaith, <hi>a Name above all Names,</hi> and therefore more Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than <hi>Jehovah;</hi> for it is the moſt proper Name, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of the word Incarnate, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently contains all the names of Chriſt, and comprehends the whole work of the Incarnation, wherein are manifeſted all the divine Attributes: and all the good that can come to us, either in Soul or Body, as well for this life, as for the future.</p>
                  <p>Shall then we Chriſtians be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, in the honour of this Sacred Name of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> can any one deem it Superſtition, or Idolatry, when we do no more, no, nor ſo much, as the Jews did do to their <hi>Jehovah;</hi> eſpecially when the Apoſtle warrants it, ſaying: <hi>that at the name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>every knee ſhould bow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Have you ſome ſatisfactory rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to give me for this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We may conſider the Name, as a word framed with Letters, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33751:40"/>as it is preſented unto our ſight, or hearing; in which reſpect there is no motive of Reverence, no more than in other words. But if we conſider it formally, as repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or ſignificative, we may find many motives of Reverence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of what is repreſented or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: which manner of Reverence, or Adoration, may be called Relative, that is, by reſpect or reverence to the perſon ſignified. In this manner the Jews did Worſhip and Adore the Book of the Law, for at the ſight thereof, they did Adore, becauſe it was given by God, and had a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him: upon which motive they did, and do at this day, ſhew all exteriour Devotion imaginable, as proſtrating, kneeling, bowing, kiſſing, putting it on their Heads, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to their Breaſts and Hearts; what wonder then if Chriſtians do the like to the Sacred name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which is an Abridgment of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Principally, when taking it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively, in as much as the final end of ſuch Adoration, or Worſhip termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33751:41"/>in the perſon named, as to what is ſignified by the name, then proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and primarily Chriſt is Honoured, and Worſhiped. And there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Adoring Chriſt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the internal word or ſpecies, which we have in our mind, and the external word or Name: for as the one cauſes Reverence to what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, without any reflection, upon the ſpecies, or internal word; ſo the name, or external word cauſes Reverence to what it ſignifies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reflection on the word. When therefore we hear the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we give the Honour, Praiſe, Glory and Worſhip to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as one may experience: and in this ſenſe, none but Infidels can deny Honour to the Sacred Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

The Praiſe, Honour, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints terminate in God; for whoſe reſpect alone, we give this Honour unto them; for the grace of God in them is the motive and cauſe thereof, otherwiſe they would not be reſpected or honoured more than other Men: beſides, as the love of our Neighbour hinders not, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes not, but includes the love of God, for whoſe ſake we love our Neighbour; ſo the honour which we give to Saints hinders not, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, but rather includes the honour of God; ſo we honour the King, and in reference to him, his Princes, Rulers and Officers, whom we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May we pray to them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> What difficulty occurs in this, occurs alſo in the prayers which we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33751:42"/>make to Men on Earth; for ſurely, if we may deſire Earthly Men to pray for us, we may deſire the ſame of the Saints in Heaven; for in this manner, and no otherwiſe we pray to the Saints. The Holy Scriptures, the Univerſal practice of God's Church in all ages, as alſo the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers, even from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time do warrant this, all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies that ever were in God's Church admit prayers to the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Can they hear us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is great ignorance, to think that the Saints do hear with corporal Ears, which for the preſent they have not, for now they are pure Spirits, ſo that their hearing is nothing elſe, but a pure viſion or knowledge of things preſented to their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is not limited to place or ſenſible Objects, but moved by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in ſpecies; as they have a being repreſented unto them; whence as they ſee God, and in him they ſee all things. Moreover as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Intelligible things are to be ſeen by the Aſpect of the underſtanding,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33751:43"/>and corporal things may be ſeen by the Spirit, and Bodies are ſeen by the Spirit; for the Object of the underſtanding is all things that have a being.</hi> So the Angels did hear; or ſee (which with them is all one) as the Prophet <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> teſtifies, did ſee the Afflictions of the Cities of <hi>Juda,</hi> and therefore prayed for them: ſo our Saviour ſaith, that the Angels <hi>do rejoyce in the Converſion of Sinners:</hi> Sure they did ſee it; the Angel in <hi>Daniel</hi> did know his deſires; The Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> could tell <hi>Tobias</hi> what he did; The Hiſtory of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> doth convince it. I know ſome of our Adverſaries will turn this off, with an anſwer like themſelves, That it is but a Parable; if it were ſo, as it is not; according to the judgement of all the Fathers and Interpreters of that place; can we think that our Saviour would tell us Parables importing lies; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Devils do hear any one who calls upon them, and ſhall we think that the Saints cannot hear us? the effects of the daily experience manifeſts the one; and ſhall we doubt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33751:43"/>the other? hath God given more power to the one, than to the other? or hath God made the one leſs able to hear our prayers, and leſs powerful to relieve our Neceſſities, than the other to do us miſchief?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May we ſay</hi> Maſſes <hi>to Saints?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church honours God in his Saints, and makes memory of them in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> but never ſayes them to the Saints, as the Holy Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> declares; and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teſtifies, in many places, as alſo others of the Holy Fathers. The <hi>Maſſe</hi> then is offered only to God, and not to the Saints; but well in memory of them; as appears in all the Liturgies, where the prayers are only to God by their Merits and Prayers.</p>

And St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> tells us, that St. <hi>Mathew</hi> did firſt inſtitute it, he alſo relates the uſe and manner of the bleſſing thereof, by him preſcribed, and ſuch hath been the Cuſtome and Tradition of the Church in all times ſince.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>For what end was it uſed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The foreſaid Saint, and Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> ſayes, <hi>we bleſs Water ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Salt for the People, that all who are ſprinkled therewith may be Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Purified; for if the Aſhes of an Heifer, being ſprinkled, did ſanctifie and cleanſe the People: and if the bitterneſs
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33751:44"/>of the Water, was made Holy by the Prophet</hi> Elizeus, <hi>with Salt ſprinkled therein, by how much more things ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Divine prayers, may take away the Barrenneſs or Corruption of humane things, and ſanctifie, cleanſe, and purge the polluted; and multiply other good things, and avert the deceits of the Devil, and defend Men from extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Phantaſies.</hi> He adds another Argument, <hi>if we doubt not, but that the ſick were healed by the touch of our Saviour's Garment; how much more by vertue of his words, may the Elements divinely hallowed, bring health of Body to the weakneſs of humane Nature?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whence did the Church take this Cuſtome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church in the Benediction of Holy Water, for the Salt, takes example of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> who putting Salt into the bitter Waters, made them ſweet and uſeful; and for the Water, gives this reaſon, becauſe God has ordained the greateſt Sacraments in the ſubſtance of Water; Moreover God commanded that in every Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſhould offer Salt, which My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33751:45"/>did ſignifie purity of mind, and intention; and is an Embleme of Wiſdome, Prudence, and Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neceſſary in all Oblations. Salt alſo, according to the Scripture, and uſe of the Gentiles, was held as a Symbole of Amity, and friendſhip; <hi>a Covenant of Salt, is for ever before the Lord.</hi> In like manner the uſe of Water was very frequent, for the Prieſts being to enter into the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle or Temple, did waſh their hands and feet in the Laver, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that end; and by this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony were put in mind of what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart was requiſite to ſuch Prieſtly Functions; which was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of what is now done in the Church; wherein ſuch Veſſels are placed, near the Church doors, that every one who goes in or out, might uſe this Holy Water, in a more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual way; which was alſo aptly figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Waters of Expiation, which did Sanctifie and cleanſe the polluted.</p>
                  <p>Now the Church doth mingle Salt with Water; by the Water, to put
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33751:45"/>us in mind of our Baptiſm, and by the Salt of the purity and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on acquired in the Sacrament, ſo that by both mingled together we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Sacraments, and of the promiſes we have made. Beſides, the Water ſignifies the contrition we ought to have of our Sins, and the Salt, mortification or penitential Acts, which are to accompany ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. The Water alone may be ſaid to be Baptiſmal, but with the Salt, penitential: It doth not ſuffice us to be waſhed with Water, but we muſt alſo be purified and ſeaſoned with the fire of ardent Love. The Water cleanſes, but the Salt preſerves the Soul: by Water we are born in Chriſt, by Salt we are ſtrengthned in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; finally, to omit other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; this mixture of Salt and Water fitly repreſenteth the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: by the Salt is repreſented the Eternal word of the Father; by the Water, humane nature, whereto the word was united.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> We may gather them out of the Benediction, which the Church uſes in making it. Firſt, It is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Soul and Body. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, By vertue thereof we are defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Phantaſies, and evil Viſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, we are protected from the power, craft and deceit of the Devil. Fourthly, It hath vertue to expel and drive away evil Spirits out of the places, where we are. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To free us from the Aſſaults and Temptations of our wicked Enemy. Sixthly, To expel all evil thoughts, and ſuggeſtions. Seventhly, Againſt Tempeſts and Lightnings. Eighthly, To cure Diſeaſes. Laſtly, To take away venial Sins.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes very frequently in all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtories, I will produce ſome few; <hi>Baronius</hi> recounts, that St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us, that one <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> a converted Jew, did diſcipate the illuſion of his fellow Jews, by Holy Water; And that <hi>Theodoret</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that St. <hi>Marcel</hi> Biſhop, did by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33751:46"/>Holy Water chaſe away the Devil, who hindered the Demolition of a Heatheniſh Temple: St. <hi>Hubert</hi> by Holy Water did free one from the violent Phantaſms of the Enemy. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> by it, did cure a ſick Man. St. <hi>Quintian</hi> did by it cure a whole Family. St. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> did by it, cure a broken Thigh of a Goth; St. <hi>Anſelme</hi> reſtored ſight to a blind Man. St. <hi>Malachie</hi> did heal a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a Canker. St. <hi>Addo</hi> did by it, cure a Lunatick. Of this alſo we have many examples amongſt the Converted <hi>Indies,</hi> as alſo in our own Countrey, which many have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whence comes theſe effects?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The principal and ſole efficient cauſe, is the power and will of God, who hath left ſuch Miniſterial power in his Church, whereto he hath given Authority, in his Name to caſt out Devils, and evil Spirits, to heal the ſick, to remit ſins, and ſuch like. The material cauſe is ſenſible and exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things, applyed by the ſame Church, from the Apoſtles, to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33751:47"/>effects; which both Teſtaments do warrant. Our Saviour himſelf giving examples thereof, by uſing Spittle, Clay, waſhing with Water, curing by the hem of his Garments, and giving power to his Diſciples to cure the ſick with Oyl, which they did alſo by their Napkins; yea by their ſhaddows. The formal cauſe by which ſuch effects are wrought, is the Benediction, which conſiſts in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſms and Invocation of God's Name; the Exorciſm declares the power which is given to Prieſts. The Invocation implores God's concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereto; or rather that it may take effect in thoſe who uſe it: the final cauſe is the manifeſtation of God's glory and power, and the good of our Souls.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Benediction is diverſly taken; for God bleſſes us, and we bleſs God; the Benediction we give to God, is no other thing, then to praiſe God, or to give thanks to him, or to ſing his glory; which is frequent in the Scripture. The Benedictions which God gives, are his gifts and graces, which he imparts to his Creatures, for which in the fear of God we make Supplication and Prayer: Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then here is taken for Prayer to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33751:48"/>God that he would bleſs this Salt or Water, or any other thing. In this manner St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>that every Creature is Sanctified by the word of God and Prayer.</hi> So the Prieſts in the old Law had power to Sanctifie the People, and all things which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to their Sacrifices; and in this manner the Church hath her Prieſts, who by their Ordination, have power to bleſs and Sanctifie ſuch things, as are Sacramental, or for the ſpiritual profit of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt in ſprinkling of Holy Water, and Chriſtians in take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſay that of the Pſalmiſt;</hi> Thou ſhalt ſprinkle me with <hi>Hyſope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is the frequent cuſtome of the Church, to uſe words of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, for the Devotion of the faithful, in ſome pious ſenſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not the ſame with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe of thoſe words: and therefore as the Holy Water hath a Myſtical ſignification, principally in order to the Soul, ſo ſhe takes theſe words in a Myſtical ſenſe, importing the principal effect of the Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33751:49"/>which is to purge and cleanſe our Souls from ſin and ſinful affections.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Hyſope</hi> both for its formal uſe, and Myſtical ſignification, may be fitly applyed to this action; for it was uſed, nay inſtituted by God, for cleanſing from uncleaneſs, to which end they were to dip <hi>Hyſope</hi> in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Aſhes, and to ſprinkle all the Tent, and all implements, and the Men: and ſo be freed from pollution or contagion. And again this <hi>Hyſope</hi> dipped in Sparrows blood, did ſerve to cure the Leproſie, by being ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therewith. Now for its ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it agrees with the effects of Holy Water. For as the Phyſitians hold, <hi>Hyſope</hi> hath a certain vertue of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principally the Lights or Lungs; and to mitigate the pains of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> on the 50 Pſalm thus applyes: <hi>as the Earthly</hi> Hyſope <hi>is apt to cure the Lungs, to hinder inflamations or ſwellings of the wind; ſo man ſprinkled with celeſtial</hi> Hyſope, <hi>that is, with humility of Heart, is purged from all malignity of pride;</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine, Hyſope</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33751:49"/>ſaith he, <hi>is a ſimple or low Herb, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stomach, and ſignifies Chriſt's humility, by which we are cleanſed.</hi> Chriſtians then entring into the Church, ought to be ſprinkled with this <hi>Hyſope</hi> of Humility, that taking the Holy Water with Humility, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and compunction, they may be cleanſed and purged from all pride, and vanity; that with purity of Heart, they may be prepared for the better participation of the Sacrifice and Sacraments.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We may ſay with grief, <hi>Deus venerunt Gentes; O God, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are come into thine inheritance;</hi> for we have not the happineſs now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy our Churches: and inſtead of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33751:50"/>them, we are forced to uſe ordinary Chambers, poor Rooms, or Corners to Celebrate the Divine Myſteries in. So that in writing for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, I ſhall omit many things which might be ſaid of material Churches. I ſhall only ſay, that as we have the ſelf ſame Sacrifice, ſo we ought to have the ſame Devotion to it, in whatſoever place it is Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; we honour the Church principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Sacrifice, and not the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Church.</p>
                  <p>The very want of ſuch Churches might move us to Repentance of our ſins, which were the true cauſe of our Deſolation, and thereby ſtir up our Hearts to make humble Supplication, and fervent Prayer, that God out of his infinite mercy would avert his juſtly provoked wrath from us; which can hardly be better done, then by devoutly ſaying the foreſaid Pſalm, which is in the Primer after the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, with prayers proper for that end; we may alſo on the other ſide, exalt and raiſe up our Hearts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the primitive times, when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33751:50"/>the firſt Chriſtians by reaſon of great perſecutions: were forced to ſerve God in the ſame manner; that is, in the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> O that we would imitate their fervour and Piety, their Zeal and Charity, their Devotion and Patience. VVhen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſumptuous material Edifices, they laboured to raiſe the ſpiritual Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; adorned with all manner of vertue, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed deſires of ſuffering for the love of him who ſuffered for us: more greedy of the Croſs or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, than we are of this droſs which we ſo much eſteem; nay they did run after them, that thereby they might aſcend to the Caeleſtial Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</p>
                  <p>VVe may alſo reflect upon the times of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and pull down all Chriſtian Churches: at leaſt ſhall labour to bring them all to ruine, as the enemies of Chriſt have alwayes done; We have truly great reaſon to ſuſpect, that his time is not far from us, ſith the precurrent ſigns are manifeſted.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33751:51"/>If any one would peruſe St. <hi>Hipoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his Diſcourſe of thoſe times, he might eaſily ſee how agreeable his fore-runners are to his Maxims, of abjuring the Croſs of Chriſt, his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Sacrifice, and particularly in the ruine and deſtroying of Churches and Altars, at leaſt defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is there no Reverence due to the places, where the Sacrifice is Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes ſurely; for as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the principalleſt motive of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Church, is becauſe this. Sacrifice is offered in it: ſince then by the mercy of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of the Church, we have the Sacrifice, we ought to ſhew all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in thoſe Places where it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. It is the ſelf ſame God that is in the Churches, which is in other Places, the ſame Sacrifice; and we ought as greedily to come to it, in the one as in the other; and we may obtain the ſame Graces, Benedictions and fruit of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> in any place where it is Celebrated; and in thoſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33751:51"/>places. Chriſt Communicates his Grace, the Sacraments are imparted to us, and there we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Merits, and Chriſt Jeſus, God and Man is really and corporally preſent.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What are Altars?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The word Altar, comes from the Latin word <hi>Altare,</hi> which ſignifies a high place for to Sacrifice in; ſo <hi>Ara,</hi> as St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſayes, comes from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> from burning, becauſe the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims were burnt thereon. Now this Altar was elevated above the reſt of the Pavements, for the Commodity of him who Sacrifices, as alſo to ſhew the Dignity of the place, where the Sacrifice was offered, and is no other, than a Table ordained for that end, and Conſecrated and Dedicated to God; and therefore is not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the Holy Fathers called a Table; St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> without any difference calls it ſo, ſaying: <hi>This Table is full of Spiritual fires, for on this Altar is God himſelf, who is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33751:52"/>fire.</hi> And in another place he ſayes, <hi>The Altar is dreadful and Admirable for the Sacrifice which is made on it;</hi> and again, <hi>The Table ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the place of the Manger; whence</hi> Optatus calls it the ſeat of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Of what matter were they made?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> Ever ſince Pope <hi>Silveſter</hi>'s time, which is above 1340 Years paſt, they were of Stone, and is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it was ſo alſo in the Apoſtle's time; for Pope <hi>Higin,</hi> who was the Tenth from St. <hi>Peter, ordained that Altars ſhould be Conſecrated, not only by the unction of Chriſme, but alſo with ſacerdotal Benediction: but if the Altars be not of Stone, let them not be Conſecrated;</hi> there were indeed at that time Wooden Altars by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or by reaſon of the continual perſecutions, but now all of Stone.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But why of Stone?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We may ſay, that in a Moral ſenſe, the Stone is more ſolid, not ſo porous as wood is generally ſpeaking; but in a Myſtical ſenſe it is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Stone, which was put on our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33751:52"/>Saviour's Sepulcher; and as that Stone was ſealed, ſo the Altar-Stone is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſigned with Five Croſſes, one in the middle, and one in each Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; to ſhew that the Catholick Church extended to the Four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World, is united in the Croſs of Chriſt Jeſus. In contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation whereof, Catholicks are wont on <hi>Munday, Thurſday,</hi> Devoutly to kiſs the Altar-Stone, which is then uncovered and laid bare. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> who lived well nigh 1300 Years paſt, tells us, <hi>That the Stone by Nature is common, but being Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God's Worſhip, receives Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is to be touched only by Prieſts.</hi> And St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who was not long after, affirms, that the <hi>Church was wont to Celebrate the Solemnity, in which the Stone, whereon the Divine Sacrifices are Conſecrated for us, was Apointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Have we any ſuch Altars now?</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What doth the Altar repreſent?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It may repreſent the little Manger, whereon our Saviour new-born was laid; but more properly the Table whereon our Saviour in the night before his Paſſion, did Inſtitute for our ſpiritual Food, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sacrament of his Body and Blood which was prefigured accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> St. <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Rupert</hi> and others by the Table of propoſition; for in it the Bread of Life is preſented unto us. It may alſo
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33751:54"/>fitly repreſent the <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> where the Croſs was placed; whence the <hi>Crucifix</hi> is alwayes ſet thereon. Not unfitly it may alſo repreſent the Monument, wherein our Saviours Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was laid; for his Body and Blood is laid on the Altar; but if we will take it in a more Myſtical manner, we may ſay, that it repreſents unto us the Judgement of Chriſt in the laſt day; which repreſentations will Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter us pious matter of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. For ſometimes we may Contemplate the little Child laid in the <hi>Cribb:</hi> and ſo Adore our new-born Jeſus, who came then to work our Redemption, and here comes to give himſelf unto us as a certain pledge thereof: ſometimes to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, that the Altar, is as the Table whereon our Saviour did give himſelf unto us for our ſpiritual Food, and ſtrive with all ardent Devotion, to accompany his Diſciples there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Table. Sometimes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that in coming to the Altar, we are going to the <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> there to behold the whole Paſſion of our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33751:55"/>Saviour, after the Judgement which <hi>Pilate</hi> paſſed on him; and call to mind that Chriſt did carry his Croſs thither for our ſake, let us endeavour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Other times we may go in Spirit with the <hi>Maries</hi> to find him in the Sepulcher, that is, to imitate their Devotions in ſeeking their Maſter, and rejoyce that we may find him on the Altar. Laſtly, we may call to mind the ſaying of <hi>St.</hi> Paul, <hi>He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgement to himſelf.</hi> For Chriſt ſits on the Altar as in a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat; for as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>he loves Mercy and Judgement:</hi> they both go as Companions together. No where hath God ſhewn greater Mercy than in this Sacrament, yet ſo, that if we do abuſe his Mercy, we can expect no other thing but Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>May we adore the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I hope none will be ſo Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as to think that Chriſtians Adore the Altar, as having any Diety in it; we Adore and Reverence the Altar, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Adore towards the Holy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33751:55"/>Temple:</hi> and why? not for its materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subſtance, nor for its Ornaments, but for that our Lord is pleaſed there to make his abode; or as he <hi>adored God's foot-Stool,</hi> by which the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> underſtood the Ark; or as <hi>Daniel kneeled down Three times a day towards</hi> Jeruſalem where the Temple ſtood. If this may be done to the Ark and Temple: with much more reaſon may we do it before the Altar; which hath Reference to the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> that is, the true Body and Blood of Chriſt; ſo that all the Reverence, Worſhip and Adoration which we make before the Altar, is referred to God, in whoſe reſpect alone it is due.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Nothing but the Figure or Image of Chriſt Crucified, which the Church has uſed to put on the Altar; to put us in mind of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion, whereof the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33751:56"/>Commemoration, for which Chriſt hath left this Sacrifice as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, amongſt other means, that the Church hath to engraft this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt's Paſſion in the hearts of the faithful: ſhe maketh uſe of the Crucifix or figure of Chriſt on the Croſs; that our eyes receiving the ſpecies, may carry it to the heart; our ſenſe is ſo powerful in that effect, none will ſay, but that it is good to Preach it often, that we may have it in our hearts; but the ſight of it even in figure makes a deeper impreſſion in the mind, and that it has been the cuſtome of the Church to have Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes on the Altar, is manifeſt by continual Tradition.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What reaſon have you for it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Many, in correſpondence to the Altar whereon it is placed, which as I ſaid before, may fitly repreſent the <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> and the Crucifix, the Croſs of our Saviour. Secondly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Conformity to the Altar, in as much as it hath a Repreſentation of the Judgement Seat, we may conſider the Crucifix as repreſenting the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33751:56"/>Croſs, which will appear in that day of Judgement; which Croſs, Chriſt calls the <hi>Sign of the Son of Man.</hi> Thirdly, as the Banner among Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, is put in an eminent place, or at the head of the Army; So the Church puts the Croſs in the moſt eminent place; to wit, on the Altar, as the Banner and Trophy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and of our King Chriſt Jeſus. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>we do all rejoyce in the confeſſion of Chriſt, who glories in the Sign of the Croſs; for he cannot be eſteemed to be of the Chriſtian</hi> Militia, <hi>unleſs with a faithful hand, he erect the Standard of him Crucified. Leontius</hi> above a Thouſand years ago, ſayes, <hi>The Croſs is to be drawn in the Holy place of the moſt Sacred Church towards the</hi> Eaſt (that is, the Altar, which is for the moſt part towards the <hi>Eaſt) for by the Salutiferous Croſs, Man-kind is freed, and by this, hope is declared to thoſe who deſpair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May the Crucifix be Adored?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Yes, as hereafter I ſhall more fully declare; in the mean time, for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33751:57"/>this we have a known example of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> who ſeeing the Croſs prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him, cryed out, <hi>Hail, O Croſs, which art dedicated in Chriſt's Body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O good Croſs, which haſt received honour and beauty from the members of Chriſt: long deſired, ſedulouſly loved, ſought without intermiſſion, and at laſt prepared to a deſirous mind, take me from Men, and reſtore me to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who by thee redeemed me. Loe, how the bleſſed Apoſtle adores the Croſs, which was a figure or Image of Chriſt's Croſs. And <hi>Leontius</hi> before cited, <hi>The Sons of Chriſtians adoring the Type of the Croſs, do not adore the nature of the Wood, but beholding Chriſt himſelf; for by this we ſalute and adore him, who was crucified thereon.</hi> And St. <hi>John Damaſcene, truly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and venerable Wood whereon Chriſt has once offered himſelf for us, as Sanctified by the touch of his Body and Blood, is, decently to be adored; the Nails, Sphear and Cloth, alſo: we adore alſo the figure or Image of the pretious and life giving Croſs, although it be made of another material; not Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33751:57"/>the matter</hi> (far be it from us) <hi>but the figure as the ſign of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence we may gather, that no Catholick adores the material ſubſtance of Croſſes, or the painting of them: but as the Holy Fathers ſay, what is repreſented by them; in which ſenſe they have nothing but a repreſentative being, and as it is ſaid before, terminates only on the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type. Yet I cannot ſay, but that the true Croſs of Chriſt Dignified by Chriſt's Body and Blood, may have a Religious reſpect and adoration, which is not found in others, but only in as much as they repreſent Chriſt Crucified, and in him, and for him, as to him, to be adored.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What uſe do Chriſtians make by the Crucifix on the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Firſt, we have Copious matter of Devotion, the Type of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Secondly, We have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of compaſſion on our Saviour's ſuffering for our ſake. Thirdly, Of compunction, in conſidering &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our ſins have been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof. Fourthly, Of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33751:58"/>for ſo ineſtimable a benefit of our Redemption on the Croſs. Fifthly, Of Imitation, by having a willing mind to ſuffer for him, who hath ſuffered ſo much for us. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Of Hope, which nothing confirms ſo much, as that Chriſt dyed for us on the Croſs. Seventhly, Of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for there never was a greater, nor yet ſo great a ſubject of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that God ſhould dye an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death on the Croſs, for our Sins. Eighthly, Of Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for God could not ſhew greater love to us, than to debaſe himſelf for our ſakes. Laſtly, To omit what each ones Devotion may ſuggeſt, we are thereby excited to the exerciſe of Patience, in all our Afflictions, Tribulations and Perſecutions: with theſe and ſuch like Conſiderations, all Catholicks entering into the Church, and beholding the Crucifix, do ſign themſelves with the ſign of the Croſs, as conforming their will to ſuffer for Chriſt Jeſus, and to arme themſelves from the Temptations of the Enemy.</p>

                  <head>4. Of Images.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it lawful to have Images in the Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Our Controvertiſts have ſo amply declared this, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs here to treat of this Subject: I will only take notice here, that many Councels have determined this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but eſpecially the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> held well nigh Nine hundred years ago, where there were 330 Biſhops aſſembled, expreſly on this Subject. This Councel was held in <hi>Greece,</hi> where the oppoſite Hereſie did begin ſome years before, with great conteſt in thoſe parts, whereas the Weſtern Church did alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Worſhip and uſe of Images, and in three ſeveral Councels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Hereticks in the Eaſtern Church; and this was done in <hi>Nice</hi> in the moſt ſolemn manner, and with the greateſt diſpute, that ever was ſeen in any Councel; on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers ſide all the reaſons imaginable, from whence the Hereticks of our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33751:59"/>times have taken their Arguments; on the Catholick defenders ſide, Scriptures, Tradition, Cuſtome, Judgement of the Holy Fathers, continual practiſe of God's Church were alleaged, with clear and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt anſwers to all contrary Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whence the Councel unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly determined the uſe and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May we adore them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We may not adore them, but before them, or in beholding them, we may adore what is repreſented by them; according to the old verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt's Picture Worſhip thou, who by the ſame doeſt paſs,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet Picture Worſhip not, but Chriſt for whom it pictured was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Picture be of God, we give Divine Worſhip to him; if of Saints, we then give a Religious Worſhip, which is due to them; for our Worſhip doth not terminate in the Pictures, but in the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. The Pictures or Images, do
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33751:59"/>ſerve only as repreſentatives, in ſome manner like the ſpecies which falls not under our ſenſes or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in as much as they repreſent the Objects; we have no knowledge of God, but by the ſpecies, which ſerves only to ſupply the place of the Object; and does not terminate or bound the underſtanding in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; ſo that we know the Object by the ſpecies; but yet take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſpecies. The object of the ſenſes is the ſenſible quality, which the ſenſe does not perceive, but the ſpecies, in as much as they are repreſentatives of ſuch qualities; So it is alſo in Pictures or Images, which by their repreſentative nature, being beheld or ſeen, do lead us to the knowledge of the thing repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: we may experience this in the Picture of a Perſon we love; when we ſee the Picture, we are moved with a new affection, not to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but to the Perſon it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore are they put in Churches?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:33751:60"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> For many reaſons; firſt, for Ornament of the Churches, which is warranted by the Scriptures, where God commanded the Images of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubines</hi> to be made in the Ark, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> put Cherubes in many places of the Temple, why then may not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians place Images in their Churches.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in all the Churches he built, did put Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Pictures, and Statues of Chriſt, and his Saints; for their Ornament. <hi>Iſodore Peluſiat,</hi> who lived about the year 440. is ſo far for it, that he ſayes the place cannot be ſaid to be a Church which is not adorned with Images. It is ſtrange that Men adorn their Houſes with prophane Pictures or Images; and think that holy Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures repreſenting Sanctity, Piety, and Devotion, to be Prophanation in the Church. Secondly, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and help of the ignorant, who by thoſe Images, do learn the Myſteries of our Faith, as the learned do by Books and Characters, which are but as Images. St. <hi>John Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> ſayes, <hi>That our Holy Fathers did
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33751:60"/>judge it convenient to ſet forth the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Paſſion in Pictures or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the unlearned, or thoſe who could not read, might refreſh their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories thereby</hi> VVhence <hi>Tharaſius Patriark</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſayes, <hi>whatſoever the Goſpel ſhews unto us by reading, the ſame is ſeen by Images; whatſoever alſo Books ſpeak of Holy Martyrs ſufferances, the ſelf ſame is ſignified by Images.</hi> Letters are but Images of the things ſignified, and Images but Letters for the Ignorant; yea to the learned for a more ſpeedy repreſentation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſerve to move the beholders to Piety and Devotion, for naturally we are moved by viſible objects to good or evil: whence the Church hath alwayes commended, though not commanded, good Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and ſtrictly forbidden bad ones, principally Prophane and Laſcivious. None who have any Civility will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that. Laſcivious Images, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, or Statues are dangerous, and ſure it cannot be evil to have good Images, which ſavour of Piety; and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33751:61"/>if thoſe cauſe ill diſpoſitions in the mind, theſe may cauſe good, which St. <hi>Baſile</hi> thus declares, <hi>Hiſtorians and Painters do often deſcribe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conflicts, and great Deeds of Warlick Men, thoſe ſet them forth by Orations, theſe paint them in Tables: both of them have provoked many to Vertue, to wit, as the one perſwades by his moving words; ſo the other draws by his lively repreſentation,</hi> of the things done by our Saviour and his holy Servants.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to omit other reaſons, theſe Pictures or Images are placed to put us in mind of the Sanctity of the place; wherein none but Holy Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are to be permitted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is declared the Reverence of the place, and indeed when one comes to a Church adorned, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Houſe of God, eſpecially with Pictures, Images and Statues, he cannot but adore God to whom all this preparation is made, for it has ſome reſemblance of Heaven, where God is ſaid to be with his Angels and Saints adoring him, with fear and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33751:61"/>Reverence; for here by Faith we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt Jeſus God and Man to be really preſent; and we contemplate in Spirit the Angels and Saints, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying him under the forms of Bread and Wine we ſee our God; and in the Images we ſee his Angels and Saints.</p>

                  <head>5. Of Tapers or Candles.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Church uſe Candles at</hi> Maſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All Nations, Gentils, Jews, and Chriſtians, have alwayes uſed Lamps, Candles or Tapers in the Service of God; the cuſtome of the Gentils is manifeſt in their Hiſtories: of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the firſt Book of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and of the Chriſtians in all ages, as the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories do Record: and the firſt who oppoſed it in the Church, was <hi>Vigilantius</hi> above 1200 years paſt; againſt whom even in this point, the Holy Fathers St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and St. <hi>Paulin</hi> did write in defence of the Catholick cuſtome, St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Evodius</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:33751:62"/>make mention of it; and we may gather that ſuch was the cuſtome of the Church, for that our <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who built and erected many Churches; amongſt other his gifts to the Churches, did add poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and Lands for the maintenance of ſuch Lights, Lamps and Candles in the Churches. I might here alleage Councels and Hiſtories for the uſe thereof, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Only I will note, that the Office of <hi>Acholithus</hi> (which is one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Eccleſiaſtical Orders, called alſo <hi>Ceroforarius</hi> acknowledged by the Popes <hi>Cayus, Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> all in the primitive times: as alſo St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Roman Councel under <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and the Third Councel of <hi>Carthage</hi> held in the year 436.) Was to light the Candles at <hi>Maſſe;</hi> and to carry them in ſeveral times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as when the Goſpel is read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the reaſon thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In ſuch things as are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Rule is the beſt, <hi>we do not reprove, but praiſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing others thereto, we follow and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33751:62"/>whatſoever is not contrary to Faith, or contrary to good manners, and has ſomething of exhortation to a better life: whenſoever we ſee them to be inſtituted, and know them ſo ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For as the ſame Saint ſaith, <hi>many things which are not found in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles: nor in later Councels; nevertheleſs, becauſe they are obſerved by the whole Church, are believed to have been delivered and commanded by the Apoſtles,</hi> we find alſo mention of theſe Lamps or Candles in their Canons.</p>
                  <p>Now the Church uſes them, as a manifeſtation of the honour due to ſuch a Sacrifice, and an Embleme of our Faith, to put us in mind that the light of our Faith ſhould ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, that God may be glorified. For in the Benediction of the <hi>Paſchal</hi>-Candle, in the honour of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection the Church ſayes, <hi>we pray that the Taper Conſecrated in the honour of thy name,</hi> and in the bleſſing of the Candles on <hi>Candle-maſday,</hi> prayes that <hi>we may bear them to the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his name, and be enflamed by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33751:63"/>the light of the Divine Benediction: and that as the Candles kindled by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire do expel darkneſs, ſo our hearts may be illuminated by inviſible fire, that is, by the ſplendour of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that theſe Candles were alſo as a ſign of honour, is manifeſt by what we read in St. <hi>John Damaſcene</hi> in the life of <hi>Balaam and Joſaphat, innumerable multitudes from all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Regions did honourably flock to adore and ſee the bodies of thoſe men, with Hymns, and Canticles, and Lamps, and Tapers burning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the encreaſe of our Faith, the Tapers or Candles repreſent unto us our Saviour, who came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the World, the Wax fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Chriſt's humanity: for as the wax is made by Virgin-Bees, ſo the fleſh of Chriſt was taken from the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and as the wax is conſumed, ſo Chriſt's fleſh was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the fire is a Symbole of the Diety, for God is ſaid to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire; the Week which joyns the wax to the fire, repreſents the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33751:63"/>union of the Diety, to his Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the light proceeding from all three, fitly ſignifies the Evangelical Doctrine; which is the light of the World, and which the Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents by theſe burning Candles, to put us in mind of the profeſſing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole World.</p>
                  <p>Again, the white wick may ſignifie unto us the purity of Conſcience, requiſite to the due performance, or attendance to this dreadful Sacrifice; the wax the Humility, Obedience, and Submiſſion to the will of God; that as the wax is moulded, ſhaped, figured, and framed, according to the will of the Artificer: ſo with a willing and prompt mind, we might ſubmit our ſelves to the Divine operation in our Souls, and Body: and as the wax receives any impreſſion, ſo we might ſubmit our ſelves to receive what ever God ſhall pleaſe to ſend us, as Tribulations, Afflictions, and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; yea Death it ſelf. When we ſhall do both, if we burn with the love of God, and as the flame aſcends to its center, ſo our minds enflamed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33751:64"/>with the love of God, ſhall alwayes be elevated, leaving the earthly droſs, tending to our center which is God.</p>

                  <head>Of other things which are on the Altar.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is the Altar covered with Linnen?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church has ordained, that the Altar be covered with Two Altar Cloths, or Towels at leaſt; which are bleſſed by a Prieſt, although in times of neceſſity, we may take others not bleſſed, ordinarily there are Three: ſometimes the undermoſt is of courſer Linen; all which ſeem convenient, for the preventing of dangers: which may happen by effuſion out of the Chalice; which the Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been careful to prevent, and in caſe it ſhould ſo happen, the Towels being Linen might the better be waſhed, whence the Church hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Cloth or Silk for that end; ſuch was the Decree of Pope <hi>Euſebius;</hi> who gives this reaſon, <hi>becauſe the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33751:64"/>of our Lord was buried in a Syndon or fine Linen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the little Cloth which is put above the others?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That is alſo of Linen, and is more properly a repreſentative of Chriſt's Syndon, and is called the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> for that the Body of Chriſt is laid upon it, and the Chalice by the Apoſtles, in the 72 Canon it is called a Linen Vail. Pope <hi>Soter</hi> calls them <hi>Sacred, or Conſecrated Palls.</hi> St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaith, <hi>that as the Corporal is of fine Linen purged from Earthly droſs, ſo the offerers intention ought to ſhine in ſimplicity and purity before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe this Corporal does immediatly touch the body of Chriſt under the ſpecies, for that it is Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the Biſhop, or thoſe who have Epiſcopal Authority; to the end that it may be laid under the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hoſt and Chalice, therefore none but thoſe who are in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are to touch it, as many Popes and Councels have ordained: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit the Decree which was made in a Counſel held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33751:65"/>ſhews the care that our Engliſh had of this Corporal, for Can: 3. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>the old corporals which are not fit to be uſed ſhould be put in the place of, or amongſt the Reliques, or be burnt in the preſence of the Arch-Deacon; who alſo is to take care that the Altar-Cloths and other Ornaments be Decent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The Church uſes the Chalice, after the example of our Saviour: who in the Inſtitution of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, did uſe it as neceſſary for the Conſecration of the Wine, as the Evangeliſts and St. <hi>Paul</hi> do teſtifie. Now this Chalice both for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the blood of our Lord, under the ſpecies of Wine; is Conſecrated by the Biſhop, as the Corporal, and therefore is no otherwiſe to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, by this we may learn with what veneration we ought to receive theſe Holy things, which ſerve to the Miniſtry of Chriſt's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Holy Chalices, and Holy Vails (that is the Corporals) and other things which belong to the Worſhip of Chriſt's Paſſion, not as if
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33751:65"/>theſe inanimate or ſenſeleſs things, had any Sanctity in them, but from the conjunction of our Lord's Body and blood.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the form of the Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The form of the Chalice, was figured in the old Law; for <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Obſervations of Antiquities, deſcribes the <hi>Jews</hi> Chalice in this manner, ſaying, <hi>It is a Golden Cup in form of a Globe cut in Two parts, with a hollow ſpace within, by little and little decently dilating it ſelf, from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome as a Pomegranate cut in Two: the Two halves put back to back, by a knot in the middle: the Chalice in this form was ſet in a Golden Crown, which the High Prieſts did wear, the Manna was reſerved in ſuch a Cup, whence the</hi> Jews <hi>on their Money did imprint ſuch a Chalice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this form it may be a Symbole of Heaven, divided into Two parts; and as Heaven includes all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary VVorld; ſo in the Chalice the Sacrifice of the Univerſal VVorld is offered by the Prieſt. The Chalice in the High Prieſt's head, repreſents
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33751:66"/>the Chalice elevated above the Prieſt's head in <hi>Maſſe,</hi> that of the Manna, was a compleat figure of our Chalice, which carries in it the true Manna Chriſt Jeſus: and that of the <hi>Jews</hi> Money, repreſents that all our works are of no value, not right coyn, unleſs they be marked with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Paſſion of Chriſt Jeſus, which this Chalice repreſents.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the matter of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> For the moſt part, is either of Gold or Silver, and in times of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or perſecution in Pewter, yea in Lead, Braſs, Glaſs and Wood; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the primitive times: But in proceſs of time, it was ordained by the Church, that they ſhould not be of Glaſs, by reaſon of its bricleneſs, with peril of effuſion: nor in Wood, becauſe it is ſpongy, and porous, whereby the blood of our Lord might fcak into the Wood, and other inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies: nor of Copper or Braſs, by reaſon of their noyſomneſs; but of Gold or Silver, and of Pewter by permiſſion, or through want. St.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33751:66"/>
                     <hi>Maximus</hi> ſayes, <hi>that Gold ſhews the pretious Redemption from our Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Silver the price wherewith we were bought,</hi> and Pewter our miſery and poverty; Gold is a Symbole of charity, Silver of Sanctity, Pewter of humility and miſery.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Patten?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Patten, Plate, or little diſh, is as ancient in the Church, as the Chalice, and ordinarily is of the ſame Mettal with it: and ſerves for the Oblation and Communion of Chriſt's Body, as the Chalice for his blood: and as <hi>Theophilact</hi> notes, <hi>the open Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fignifies the open heart of Chriſt in the Latitude of Charity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a Symbole of the unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extent of Chriſt's Charity, in his Paſſion; which we feel and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Holy <hi>Maſſe;</hi> and is in all reſpects to be Reverenced as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, wherewith it is alſo Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33751:67"/>amongſt the Corporals, which did ſometimes ſerve to put under the Chalice, and folded, did alſo cover it: ſo that we may apply to it, what is ſaid of Corporals with very little difference, only they are not Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, for it is white Linen, and is called <hi>Purificatory,</hi> as being a little Towel to purifie or cleanſe the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Patten in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to dry and wipe the Chalice after the Lotions; and to that end is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be kept clean and neat, and by reaſon it hath ſo near a connexion to the blood of our Saviour, is not to be touched nor waſhed, otherwiſe than the Corporals; this repreſents the Napkin on our Saviours Head; as St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>wrapt up a part into one place,</hi> whence we may note, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> affirms, that beſides the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, there were other Linen Cloths; for he and St. <hi>John</hi> ſpecifie Cloths: So that the Altar Towels may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Cloths: the Corporal, the Syndon: and the Purificatory the Napkin on his Head.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the Vail which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Chalice.</hi>

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:33751:67"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church uſes the Vail for decency, although we may ſay that the firſt uſe of it was to cover the Chalice, from the ſight of the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens,</hi> who were wont to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the <hi>Maſſe</hi> until the Offertory, when they were diſmiſſed the Vail was taken off: Now with this for the better covering the Chalice, there is a Pall, which is uſed to cover the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, when this Vail is taken away for the avoiding of any duſt or flyes that might fall into the Chalice.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If we reflect on what God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the Law, given to <hi>Moſes;</hi> we may not wonder at this, for he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33751:68"/>commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to make a Holy Veſture to <hi>Aaron</hi> for glory and beauty, wherein he being Sanctified, might Miniſter to God, and naming the Veſtments <hi>Rational, Ephod, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, a ſtreight Linen Garment, a Mitre and a Girdle,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>they ſhall make Holy Veſtments, that they may do the functions of Prieſthood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me:</hi> by theſe Veſtments ſayes St. <hi>Bede,</hi> the Prieſts were admoniſhed of Juſtice, and Sanctity; as alſo of their Office and Function. Now if it were ſo in the Old Law, where all things were done in Figures and Types, with how much more reaſon ought the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>New Law</hi> to have Veſtments befitting their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Miniſtery, for the greater Glory and Ornament in the true and real Sacrifice, ordained by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſuch has been the cuſtome of God's Church, as in the particulars ſhall be declared.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath made a whole Treatiſe of them in general, affirming <hi>That theſe Veſtments do ſignifie that Biſhops and Prieſts ought to have ſpecial
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33751:68"/>Vertues,</hi> to which end, ſayes he, in another place, <hi>Divine Religion hath Veſtments for the Miniſtery, different from the Common:</hi> That, ſayes he, <hi>the Clergy may perform our Lord's Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a clear Conſcience, and that they may be new Men in Chriſt; as well in Vertues, as in Veſtments,</hi> which <hi>Ivo</hi> ſeconds, ſaying, <hi>The Prieſtly Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Veſtment, are Marks or Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Vertues; by which, as by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or books, they are admoniſhed, to whom they are to direct their actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Natural reaſon, and common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity teach us, that as there is diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons and quality, ſo there is diſtinction of Garments and other Ornaments, agreeable to their ſtate and condition; even according to their Offices and actions: neither was their ever a Nation ſo barbarous, but that it obſerved a diſtinction of exteriour Habits, or Apparel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Clergy and the Laity; and likewiſe amongſt the Laity in time of Judicature, or ſuch like; and amongſt the Clergy in their Sacrifice and Functions.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:33751:69"/>
                  <p>Can there be any thing more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, then that the Prieſts ſhould have decency in Garments, ſutable to their Actions or Functions; that all may know what they are a doing, and they themſelves be mindful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of what they are doing. So the Pope's Patriarks and Biſhops have their ſeveral ſorts of Garments, and all of them as Prieſts have Veſtments agreeable to the Holy Sacrifice, which as hath been often ſaid repreſents Chriſt's paſſion, and therefore the Prieſt goes veſted to the Altar, as Chriſt went to the Croſs; So that when we ſee the Prieſt thus Veſted, we may piouſly contemplate our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour going to offer himſelf on the Croſs for our ſakes; which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the particulars.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Amice</hi> is made of fine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, in form ſomewhat larger then long, with Two ſtrings, tyed at each end, which put croſs-wiſe over the breaſt are tyed about the middle: In the middle of it from the ſtrings there is a croſs: and it is called <hi>Amice</hi> from <hi>Amictus</hi> as a Vail for that it covers, firſt the Head, then the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; whence the Grecians, as alſo St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> call it <hi>Humerale</hi> a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Shoulders.</p>
                  <p>In putting it on, the Prieſt, firſt kiſſes the Croſs, in honour of Chriſt's Croſs; and thereby calls to mind the paſſion of our Saviour; which in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> he is to repreſent. Then he puts the <hi>Amice</hi> before his face, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in repreſenting the Vail which was put on Chriſt, therein preparing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33751:70"/>himſelf, to imitate our Saviour. Then he puts it on his Head, to repreſent the Crown of Thorns; or by both ſignifying the abſtraction of his mind from all worldly things, and applying his whole thoughts, to what he is now to do, and therefore putting it on his Head he kneels down, manifeſting by this Ceremony, his Reverence and high eſteem of this imployment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and framing his intentions and deſires to the will of God; then putting it about his neck, he ſubmits himſelf to the yoke of Chriſt, or to the execution of this Sacred action: and ſo letting it down on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, preparing himſelf in Obedience, or by the command of the Church, to execute this his Function, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all labours for Chriſt; which as <hi>Alcuinus</hi> ſayes, the <hi>Amice</hi> does ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie. <hi>Rupert</hi> adviſes the Prieſt to fold the <hi>Amice</hi> afterward on the mouth of the <hi>Chaſule;</hi> then he puts the ends of it on the Breaſt, and with the foreſaid ſtrings tyes or faſtens it on his Breaſt, to ſignifie his cordial love, and earneſt deſires to bear the foreſaid yoke. Or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33751:70"/>as <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third ſayes, to ſhew the fortitude of his mind, the ſtrings which faſten the <hi>Amice</hi> may ſignifie Intention, and Attention: Intention to do it according to the Church: and Attention to continue the mind fixed to what he is to do; they are put alſo croſs-wiſe one over the other, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that all this cannot be done, but by vertue of Chriſt's Croſs and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Laſtly, in as much as it is white, it repreſents, as <hi>Rabanus</hi> ſayes, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and cleaneſs of Heart, neceſſary to the well performing of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the</hi> Albe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Albe</hi> is made of Linen as the <hi>Amice,</hi> reaching to the ground, and covers the whole body, having ſleeves ſomewhat broad towards the ſhoulders, but narrower towards the hands, and is called <hi>Albe</hi> from the Latin word <hi>Alba,</hi> by reaſon of its whiteneſs, or a white Tunick or Coat; by St. <hi>Gregory of Nazianzen,</hi> it is <hi>Poder,</hi> a Veſtment to the heels.</p>
                  <p>In the old Law mention is made very frequently of Linen Tunicks
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33751:71"/>amongſt the Prieſts veſtments; whence we may ſuppoſe the Church did take this <hi>Albe,</hi> appropriating it to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the New Law. For St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> affirms, that St. <hi>James</hi> in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating <hi>Maſſe,</hi> did uſe Linen Cloaths; and writing of the Prieſtly Veſtments of the Old Law, he teaches, that they were more perfectly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt's Law. <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us that St. <hi>James</hi> did always go in Linen, and that in <hi>Maſſe</hi> he uſed particular Veſtments, namely the <hi>Albe, Amice</hi> and <hi>Stole,</hi> which were long time kept in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where the Prieſts and Biſhops did uſe ſuch Veſtments.</p>
                  <p>If you will, take it to have been derived from our Saviour, on whom <hi>Herod</hi> and his Souldiers did put a white Garment in deriſion, there is no incongruity in it, but rather a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Similitude of our Saviour, then going to his Paſſion; whence St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> calls it the <hi>immaculate Albe</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſigns of the Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>Albe</hi> repreſents this part of the Paſſion; So the Prieſt thus cloathed, as St. <hi>German</hi> ſayes,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33751:71"/>repreſents Chriſt's Divinity which appeared on the mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> when his Garments became as white as Snow; ſhewing thereby, that what he is to do, is not by humane power or Ordination: but from God's power and Ordination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Honorius</hi> ſayes, therefore Chriſt's Miniſters do Miniſter in white Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe the Angels, Miniſters of the eternal King, did appear in white, and are thereby admoniſhed to imitate thoſe Angels, God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in cleaneſs of Chaſtity in Chriſt's Service.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Steven</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Autune</hi> ſayes, that the Prieſts are Veſted with <hi>Albes,</hi> to ſhew excellent example to the People; and that the new Prieſthood is to be adorned with candid Vertues, and that Chriſt's Prieſts do put on the new Man, who according to God are created in Juſtice and Holineſs; whence according to <hi>Rabanus</hi> it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Continence and Chaſtity in the Miniſters of this Sacrifice; which <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third confirms what is now ſaid, and deſcends into ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33751:72"/>ſaying, that the long or wide <hi>Albe</hi> alſo ſignifies cleanneſs of life, ordained for the liberty of the Sons of God; <hi>Durand</hi> ſayes, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Tunick which the Jews uſed, was ſtraight and cloſe, but this of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is wide and large; the firſt had it ſo in regard of the Spirit of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; but the other hath it large, by the Spirit of Adoption, in the liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us; Laſtly, they are long as <hi>Alcuinus</hi> ſayes to ſignifie perſeverance in good works, or to hide and cover all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Garments; whence St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> avers, <hi>That the</hi> Albe <hi>ſignifies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in juſtice, and covers the whole man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore is the Girdle?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Girdle</hi> is ordinarily made of white Linen thread, and ſerves to faſten the <hi>Albe</hi> about the Prieſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and was uſed in all Sacrifices by God's command. In eating the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to gird their Loyns: and ſo without queſtion was uſed in the New Law, even for decency and commodity; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33751:72"/>the <hi>Albe</hi> being large, would hang inconveniently about the Prieſt's Body.</p>
                  <p>As for the Myſtical ſignification, we may take it from the Prophet <hi>Iſay, Juſtice ſhall be the Girdle of his Loyns, and Faith the Girdle of his Reins;</hi> for as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſayes, <hi>whilſt it girds the Loyns, it binds and mortifies the mind:</hi> whence Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> calls it <hi>the cuſtody of Chaſtity; Rabanus</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Prieſts are girded with Belts, leſt Chaſtity ſhould be remiſs and careleſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo a Symbole of prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in the ſervice of God: for thoſe who are girded, are more prompt, firm and conſtant in what they do; wherefore St. <hi>Hilary</hi> ſaid <hi>The girdle is an effectual preparation to all good, that we may be girded with promptitude, or with a prompt will in all Chriſt's Miniſtry.</hi> And St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> adds, <hi>We gird the Loyns, becauſe the Loyns are as chief ſtay and juncture of the Superiour and Inferiour parts of the Body.</hi> The Prieſt therefore girds his Loyns, to diſpoſe his Body in due Obedience to Chriſt and his Church;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33751:73"/>and his mind with fortitude and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, thereby preparing his Body and mind, to the more worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Sacred Action.</p>
                  <p>To this end, the Prieſt tyes the girdle firſt before him with a knot, which may repreſent the fear of God; which conſerves the foreſaid vertues in his heart and affection; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Devotion thereto, he may contemplate the Whips and Scourges which girded our Saviour's Body in the time of his Paſſion; in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, he deſires with great Ardour, to be bound to the Croſs and Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the</hi> Manuple?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> V. <hi>Bede</hi> tells us, that word comes from <hi>Mappa,</hi> a Towel or Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, which was uſed to wipe hands; it ſeems the Prieſts did take them to wipe off their Sweat; or, as Biſhop <hi>Steven</hi> ſayes, <hi>to dry their eyes, or wipe away</hi> the tears of Devout Prieſts; who in conſideration of their own, or their Neighbours ſins, and of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Sufferance of our Saviour's Paſſion, could not refrain from plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33751:73"/>tears; which alſo did ſometimes flow from their eyes with exceſſive joy in contemplation of the Divine bounty, which is conformable to the Prieſt's prayer in putting on this <hi>Manuple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to all probability it was Linen, proper for the ſaid effects; how it was after altered I find no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; I only find that in the time of Pope <hi>Silveſter</hi> more then 1300 years paſt, it was uſed in other ſtuff, for he decreed that the Deacon ſhould uſe Linſy-woolſey <hi>Palls</hi> on their left arm; in proceſs of time it was made of the ſame ſtuff, with the <hi>Stole</hi> and <hi>Chaſule;</hi> and ſtill retains the ſame Myſtical ſignification of tears and compunction neceſſary for thoſe, who approach to this dreadful Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>It is put on the left Arm as a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of pennance, St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſayes, that the <hi>Manuple</hi> on the left hand of the Prieſt, repreſents the Humility of Chriſt Jeſus; others commonly ſay, that it repreſents the Cords which bound our Saviour's hands, when he was taken in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33751:74"/>The Prieſt before he puts it on kiſſeth the Croſs, which is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it, as offering himſelf to go along with our Saviour to his Paſſion; and putting it on his Arme he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts his deſire to ſuffer with him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the</hi> Stole?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The word <hi>Stole</hi> comes from the Latin word <hi>Stola,</hi> that is a Robe, and in the Sacred Text is taken for a mark of Dignity and Power: So when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would honour <hi>Joſeph;</hi> he put on him a <hi>Stole,</hi> or Robe. So <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> was cloathed with a <hi>Stole</hi> for his greater honour; ſo <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſent to his Son, his Crown, <hi>Stole</hi> and Ring: and as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayes, it was uſed by Magiſtrates and Prieſts; but principally it was uſed as a badge of Eccleſiaſtical Dignity and power: yea of glory or honour, for it is ſaid, that Moiſes <hi>did put on</hi> Aaron <hi>a Stole of glory:</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> took the Robe of glory, and <hi>Jonathas</hi> as a ſign of his Prieſthood did put on a Holy <hi>Stole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church with ſome alteration of the form, has alwayes uſed the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33751:74"/>
                     <hi>Stole,</hi> as ſuitable to the Dignity, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and power of Prieſts: in the new Law St. <hi>James</hi> as hath been ſaid already, did uſe it at <hi>Maſſe. Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and others of the Fathers make mention of it; the ancient Councels did call it by the name of <hi>Orarium,</hi> as V. <hi>Bede</hi> ſayes from <hi>Oratio,</hi> becauſe it was frequently uſed in prayer, and Miniſtry of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; The Councel of <hi>Bracara</hi> ſhews the Prieſtly uſe of it, ſaying, <hi>When the Prieſt comes to celebrate</hi> Maſſe, <hi>he may not do it otherwiſe then Veſted with a</hi> Stole <hi>on both his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ſo as with one and the ſame</hi> Stole, <hi>preſſing his neck and both ſhoulders, he makes the ſign of the Croſs on his breaſt; that is, having put it firſt on his neck, he lets it fall on the ſhoulders, and taking the Two ends which hang down before, he croſſes them on his breaſt, and ſo faſtens them with the ends of the Girdle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rabanus</hi> ſayes, that the Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the publick Service of the Church, <hi>puts on the</hi> Stole <hi>about his neck, in token of his power, and as a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33751:75"/>Symbole of his Dignity in the Church: by which the People beholding the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power committed to him, are carried to the conſideration of the Divine Law.</hi> Wherefore in the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and in all ſacerdotal Functions, or Offices, Prieſts alwayes uſe the <hi>Stole;</hi> and in putting it on kiſſes it, as honouring his Function; and thereby profeſſing that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmits himſelf to the will of God; in Obedience to the Church, in vertue of the Holy Croſs and Paſſion. For as <hi>Alcuinus</hi> ſayes, the <hi>Stole</hi> ſignifies Chriſt's yoke, on both the ſhoulders; and as <hi>Amalarius</hi> tells us, it deſcends on both ſides, that the Prieſt may be armed with the armour of Juſtice, on the right and left ſide; or ſubmit himſelf to the Evangelical Obedience, to the Active life, as it is on the left ſhoulder; and to the Contemplative, as it is on the right; and forming a Croſs on his breaſt, it ſhews him crucified to the World. St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and others, will have it to repreſent the Cords which bound our
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33751:75"/>Saviour to the Pillar. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayes, that Chriſt had a Cord about his neck; and St. <hi>Hierome</hi> affirms, that it was a Chain; the Prieſt therefore as guilty, both in regard of himſelf, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe he prayes for, takes on him this <hi>Stole</hi> as a Chain or Cord about his neck, and appearing in this before the Tribunal of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he implores his Mercy by the merits of the Paſſion of Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe perſon he repreſents.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the</hi> Chaſule?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Chaſule</hi> by way of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, is called the Prieſt's Veſtment: for that all other Veſtments are uſed on other occaſions; and may be worn by others, who are in Holy Orders; for the Sub-Deacon wears the <hi>Amice, Albe</hi> and <hi>Manuple;</hi> the Deacon hath alſo the <hi>Stole,</hi> at leaſt upon the left ſhoulder to ſhew that he is for the Miniſtery; but the Prieſt only wears the <hi>Chaſule,</hi> and that only at <hi>Maſſe.</hi> This Veſtment in Latin is called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fula</hi> (from whence comes our Engliſh word) as it were a little Houſe or covering of the Body; the <hi>Grecians</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:33751:76"/>have it full and round, hanging on all ſides over the Prieſt's ſhoulders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind, but open on each ſide; and accordingly it hath divers names, as <hi>Planeta,</hi> for that it hangs looſe before and behind; other names you may read in <hi>Gavantus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may find a figure of this <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. in the Tunick of the <hi>Ephod</hi> all of Hyacinth, in the midſt whereof above was a hole for the Head, and a border round about it woven, which agrees very fitly to the <hi>Chaſule,</hi> which hath been alwayes uſed in the Church; St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſule</hi> is yet to be ſeen in <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Hugo</hi> of <hi>Cluni</hi> teſtifies. Our <hi>Alcuinus</hi> would have it to be a Symbole of Charity, for as Charity covers a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſins, and contains all the Commandements of the Law: So this <hi>Chaſule</hi> covers all the other Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hanging in Two parts before and behind, may fitly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Two Tables of the Law, or the Two Laws; the part behind, the old Law; and the part before, the new Law. The Two ſides open ſignifie
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33751:76"/>Chriſtian liberty, or the open execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>German,</hi> and others commonly do ſay, that this <hi>Chaſule</hi> repreſents unto us, the Purple Garment which the Souldiers did put on Chriſt: the Prieſt therefore in Imitation of Chriſt, puts on this Garment, which for the moſt part on the back hath a Croſs, and before, the form of a Pillar; as if the Prieſt were between the Pillar and the Croſs; for the Pillar before repreſents the Pillar whereto Chriſt was bound, and Scourged; and the Croſs behind repreſents our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour carrying the Croſs, and that very properly, that the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it may have the Croſs and Paſſion before their eyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the contemplation thereof.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, which Biſhop <hi>Ivo</hi> gives, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Theſe Veſtments are not vertues, but marks or ſigns of vertues; whereby the uſers or beholders are admoniſhed as by written Books, what they ought to deſire, and what to ſhun, and to whom they ought to direct their Actions.</hi> Pope
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33751:77"/>
                     <hi>Innocent</hi> will give another, <hi>Let the Prieſt attend diligently, that he bears not the ſign without what is ſignified: and that he carry not the Veſtment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vertue; leſt he be like to a Sepulcher outwardly whitened, and inwardly full of uncleaneſs.</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33751:78"/>us, <hi>that we ought to honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence God's Prieſts; who are higher and worthyer than all Men; and he would ſooner give reverence to a Prieſt, than to an Angel.</hi> St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <hi>That the great Abbot</hi> Anthony, <hi>as often as he met with a Prieſt, would fall on his knees, and would not riſe from the ground, until he had kiſſed his hand, and obtained his Benediction.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, For <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility,</hi> for by Prieſts the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are received into the Church, and by their Function, many ſpiritual graces are communicated unto them; beſides, the benefits they receive by the Prieſts Preaching, Inſtruction, and Miniſtration of the Sacraments; the Holy Scripture bids us <hi>to honour the Phyſitian for our neceſſity, for the Higheſt hath created him;</hi> how much more ought we to honour Prieſts, who are Spiritual Phyſitians of our Souls: for as they by their Office do make us Members of the Church, ſo they cure us of all the Diſeaſes of our Souls, and preſerve our ſpiritual lives, and bring us to Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For their Mediation, for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33751:78"/>they are Mediatours between us, and God: for it is his charge, to pray for the People; and he obtains bleſſings for them: <hi>Num.</hi> 6. Our Lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Moiſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> of Prieſts, ſaid, <hi>They ſhall invocate my Name upon the Children of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>and I the Lord will bleſs them.</hi> The wiſe Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſes us, ſaying, <hi>In all thy Soul fear our Lord, and Sanctifie his Prieſts; with all thy ſtrength love him that made thee, and forſake not his Miniſters: honour God with all thy Soul; and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Prieſts, and purge thy ſelf with the arms of Grace;</hi> to wit, the grace that God communicates unto us by the Miniſtery of the Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, In conſideration of the power which God hath given to them; eſpecially in Remiſſion of ſins, and Conſecrating of the Holy Euchariſt, for brevity ſake, I will cite One or Two of the Holy Fathers; and ſo conclude, for the firſt. Let us hear the words of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome, To thoſe who live on Earth, and are Converſant therein: it is committed to diſpoſe of thoſe things, which are in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33751:79"/>Heaven. To them it is given to have that power, which our Lord would not give to Angels, nor Arch-Angels; for it was not ſaid to them, whatſoever thou ſhalt bind upon Earth, it ſhall be bound in Heaven. Indeed the Princes on Earth, have alſo power of binding but the bodies only; but the bonds which I ſpeak of in Prieſts concerns the Soul, and reaches even to the Heavens; in ſo much, that what the Prieſt doth beneath, the ſelf-ſame God ratifies, and our Lord confirms the ſentence of his Servants: what therefore other thing can you ſay, but that all power of Celeſtial things is granted to them by God; for he ſayes, whoſe ſins ye retain, are retained: what power can be greater than this; The Father gave all power to the Son, and I ſee this power given to Prieſts, by God the Son.</hi> For the other, let us hear what St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>At this ſo honourable a priviledge Heaven is amazed, the Earth admires, Man is terrified, Hell dreads, the Devils trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and the Angels worſhip.

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt now Veſted with the foreſaid Ornaments, his thoughts and intentions are wholly Celeſtial; and therefore we muſt look upon him not as Man, but as our Angel ſent by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33751:81"/>our Holy Mother the Church: or as an Embaſſadour in fitting Equipage, to mediate our cauſe before God: his Commiſſion and Authority are from Chriſt Jeſus; his Patents are undeniably Sealed, with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Chriſt's words: his Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Letters are enrolled in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and he is choſen by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before the Angels, that you may not ſtagger in the belief thereof; in his exteriour Veſtments, he carries the Marks, Signs, and Trophies of Chriſt's Victorious Paſſion; whence we may piouſly contemplate on the Prieſt going to the Altar, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Saviour going to <hi>Mount-Calvary;</hi> and there to offer up the ſame Paſſion, which was then offered for Man-kind.</p>
                  <p>In this manner he goeth to the Altar; there to offer his intentions of offering the Sacrifice for himſelf, and all there preſent: who may do well to offer with him their intentions of hearing <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for ſuch and ſuch ends, imitating thoſe who as the Evangeliſts teſtifie, did abide before
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33751:81"/>the Croſs; ſeeing all things, not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt until all was done; the Prieſt is now to preſent the ſame Paſſion with application thereof to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does he after return from the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> When he comes from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, we may imagine that he retires from thence, in conſideration of his own unworthineſs, ſin, and iniquity, and with-draws to make firſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, whereto he requires the help of all preſent, or rather to joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them, that by mutual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they may ask pardon of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and be united in their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that with pure and joyned hearts they may offer this Sacrifice to God.</p>
                  <p>Now the Prieſt thus ſtanding in a competent diſtance, from the Altar: where he is to make his Confeſſion, imitates the Publican who ſtanding a far off, as not daring to lift up his eyes towards Heaven; but knocked his breaſt, ſaying, <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner:</hi> and in effect, ſayes with

All whatſoever you do in word or work, do all things in the name of our Lord Jeſus;</hi> and therein makes a publick profeſſion of his Faith, without which nothing is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, for in theſe words the great and principal Myſteries of our Faith; yea virtually all are contained; for in ſaying, In the Name, we profeſs and acknowledge one God: and in expreſſion of Three perſons, we alſo
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33751:83"/>declare our belief of the Trinity, and by putting our hand to the head we repreſent the Father, as the Firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, head and fountain of the Holy Trinity: drawing the hand from the head to the breaſt, repreſents the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son from the Father; and bringing the hand from the left ſhoulder to the right, between the head and breaſt, we repreſent the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, from the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, by making the ſign of the Croſs, with theſe words, the Myſteries of the Incarnation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto us; for in putting the hand to the head, &amp; ſaying <hi>In the rame of the Father,</hi> we profeſs that God the Father for the love of us, and for our Salvation, did give his only Son for our Redemption; and drawing the hand from the head to the breaſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>and of the Son,</hi> we acknowledge that the Eternal word of the Father deſcended unto us, to take humane fleſh; and by drawing the hand from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, ſaying, <hi>and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> we confeſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>So that in this place the confeſſion which is made, is of our Sins. Now this confeſſion is either private, or publick; particular, or general.

                     <hi>A.</hi> We confeſs to the Saints in other reſpects, for we confeſs to them when we have offended, in that we have offended God; even as the prodigal Child, who ſaid <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee:</hi> which the Gloſſe and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> Interprets, as if he had ſaid, I confeſs that I have offended againſt the Angels and Saints.

                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt ſay</hi> Peccavi?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To declare that he is a Sinner, and the more to expreſs himſelf, he ſayes, <hi>I have ſinned exceedingly;</hi> By the way we may note, how powerful this <hi>Peccavi,</hi> I have ſinned is, if it come from the Heart; for when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had offended God, as they often did, their only redreſs was <hi>Peccavimus,</hi> we have ſinned, and the Mercy of God was not wanting. <hi>David</hi> offended, and with his <hi>Peccavi,</hi> I have ſinned, he obtained Remiſſion. <hi>Salomon</hi> taught the People when they came into the Temple, as a remedy for all evils, and a means to obtain their Petition, to cry out, <hi>Peccavimus,</hi> we have ſinned, leaving us a perfect Model of praying in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does he ſay, in thought, word and deed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:33751:86"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That is as much to ſay, in all manner of Sin; for although ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the will, take away the will, and there is no ſin; yet this Will finds matter of ſin in our thoughts, words, and deeds.</p>
                  <p>It was ſaid of old, even by God himſelf, <hi>that all the cogitations of Mens hearts were bent to evil at all times;</hi> great was the malice of Mens hearts in thoſe times, near to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World; which ſince rather make encreaſe, than decreaſe; for the waters of Iniquity have very ſmall ebbs, but huge great Spring-Tides, and do ſo frequently overflow on the Field of our Souls; that very few flowers of vertue or piety do grow there; but innumerable Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Briars; which perhaps in quantity are not ſo great, but bring great hurt to the Soul; and if they be perverſe, they ſeparate us from God: and the beſt we can ſay or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, without the grace of God, all our cogitations or thoughts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
                  <p>In like manner we offend daily in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33751:87"/>words; for the Tongue is a Sea of evil, or as St. <hi>James</hi> ſayes, <hi>a world of Iniquity, yea the Iniquity of the Tongue fills the whole World;</hi> There is no place or perſon of what quality ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but ſome way or other, have the offending Tongue. The Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> complained ſaying, <hi>I attended and hearkned, no Man ſpeaks that which is good:</hi> would God this were all: the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of young Widdows, they learned to go about from Houſe to Houſe, <hi>ſpeaking things which they ought not.</hi> But if we look almoſt upon all ſorts of People, we ſhall find them going from this place to that place; from company to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, full of words, ſwearing; of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, curioſity: too too frequently ſpeaking things which they ought not, in detraction and back-biting, words of Iniquity as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>The words of their mouth are iniquity and guile.</hi> Our deeds are conformable; for as St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>The whole World is ſet to Iniquity;</hi> and <hi>David, All have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, they are become unprofitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there is not that doth good, there
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33751:87"/>is not one.</hi> There is ſo great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thoſe who do no good, that ſcarce any one is to be found to do good, and too too many that do evil: for as St. <hi>James</hi> ſayes, <hi>We all offend in many things,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> avers, that even the juſt do not live without ſome ſins; whence the Prieſt well ſayes, and ſo may every Man ſay, <hi>I have ſinned in thought, word, and deed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does he ſay Three times through my fault?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In this Repetition, he expreſſes the vehement ſorrow of his mind, and therefore to the laſt, he adds, through my moſt grievous fault, which is not unfrequent in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. So King <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Son</hi> Abſolon, Abſolon <hi>my Son, who would grant that I might dye for thee,</hi> Abſolon <hi>my Son, my Son</hi> Abſolon: and naturally we reiterate the cauſe of any grief. We may alſo ſay, that this Repetition is correſpondent to the Three kind of ſins before expreſſed; many do ſay that this number of Three carries with it a certain kind of Univerſality: So this Triple Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:33751:88"/>imports a confeſſion of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sins: as if he ſhould ſay, I have ſinned innumerable wayes; each time he knocks his breaſt, imitating therein the Publican, who as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Text ſayes, <hi>ſtood afar off, and would not ſo much as lift up his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, but knocked his breaſt; ſaying, Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> All which is to be ſeen in the Prieſt's action; for as is ſaid before, he ſtands afar off from the Altar, and in ſaying his <hi>Confiteor,</hi> he ſtands bowing his head towards the Earth, as not daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven, and knocks his breaſt; eſteeming, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> ſayes of the Publican, himſelf altogether unworthy to behold the Heavens, who had placed his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Earth, and Earthly things: and in holding his hands joyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his breaſt, and ſaying, <hi>Mea culpa,</hi> my fault, my fault, my moſt grievous fault, he tacitly cryes out, our Lord be merciful to me a Sinner.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the knocking of the Breaſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It hath been and is the cuſtome of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33751:88"/>all God's Servants; nay it ſeems to be a natural propenſion, to expreſs the grief or ſorrow of the mind, by ſtriking the breaſt: which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> declares, <hi>what is it,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to knock or ſtrike the breaſt; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what lyes hid in the breaſt, and by an evident or manifeſt ſtroke to chaſtiſe the hidden Sin?</hi> Or, as he ſayes in another place, <hi>to chaſtiſe our fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have offended God;</hi> and again he ſayes, <hi>The ſtriking of the breaſt, is the contrition of the heart; that is, it is a ſign or manifeſtation of the hearts contrition.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayes, <hi>We ſtrike our breaſt, as declaring the ſins encloſed inwardly in our hearts. St.</hi> Hierome, <hi>as if we would expel our evil thoughts from the heart.</hi> Pope Nicholas 1. <hi>In ſtriking the breaſt, we ſignifie that we ſtrike our ſelves before God ſtrikes us, or that we confeſs our ſelves to be worthy of ſtripes or puniſhment. St.</hi> Chryſoſtome, <hi>we take revenge of our ſelves to pacifie our Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, we ſtrike or knock our breaſt, as if we would do it to our heart or will; which has been the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33751:89"/>Original cauſe of our ſins; or as if we would open our hearts to give vent to our ſorrow and grief, for that we have offended ſo good a God: and we do it thrice, in correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Triple kind of ſin, wherein we have offended God, in thought, word and deed; or to expreſs the multitude of our ſins.</p>
                  <p>What is ſaid in Confeſſion, may proportionably be applyed to the Hearers; who I ſuppoſe have learnt the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> either in Latin, or in Engliſh; that beſides the uſe of it in other occaſions, they may joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Prieſt in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: for he beggs it of them in acknowledging his ſin before them, and deſiring them to pray for him: ſure it is as neceſſary for them: they ſtand in as much need at leaſt as he, and I know not how they can be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed, in order to a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the more beneficial hearing of <hi>Maſſe.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Clark, or he that ſerves at <hi>Maſſe</hi> prayes for the Prieſt, that God would ſhew his mercy to him, &amp; pardon his ſins, to the end that he may worthily celebrate the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and by it come to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: whoſe prayers are (as we may piouſly believe) accompanied with the interceſſion of the Angels and Saints, whoſe help he has alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated: It is a pious action in the ſtanders by, to add their Votes (which the Prieſt alſo requires) to all which the Prieſt ſayes <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When all (as the Prieſt ſuppoſes) have ſaid the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> the Prieſt makes the ſame prayer for them, who ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> do attend for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Abſolution, which the Prieſt gives, ſaying, <hi>Indulgentiam Abſolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> &amp;c. in ſaying whereof, the Prieſt makes the ſign of the Croſs on
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33751:90"/>himſelf, &amp; thereby tacitly profeſſes, that he gives this Abſolution and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by vertue of Chriſt's Croſs and Paſſion, which Communicated by the Church; the Aſſiſtants may alſo with Devotion ſign themſelves with the ſame ſign, and devoutly ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt after this makes ſome Jaculatory prayers, reciting ſome verſes of the Pſalms, expreſſing his confidence in God's mercy and goodneſs; by which he preſumes to go to the Altar, and that his prayer will be heard, which he aſſures us by <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> our Lord is with you, and therefore let us proceed to the performance of this Sacrifice; for having before declared, that God is turned unto us, he beggs his mercy in this his action, and makes his humble petition, that his prayer which he is to make therein may be heard.</p>
                  <p>It is very convenient, that thoſe who underſtand Latin, ſhould anſwer to the Prieſt with correſpondent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: thoſe who do not, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God's goodneſs in giving ſuch power to Prieſts, and with Devotion expect the grace and benefit of the Abſolution; and ſeriouſly attending to the Admonition that the Prieſt gives them in ſaying, <hi>Dominus vobiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> our Lord is with you; I am now going to the Altar, to offer Sacrifice
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33751:91"/>for you; and our Lord will be with us, in correſpondence thereto, they may devoutly ſay <hi>Et cum ſpiritu tuo,</hi> and with thy ſpirit; which becauſe it occurs frequently in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> every one ought to learn, that they may ſhew their minds to be attentive to what the Prieſt does all along in this Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>After that, the Prieſt ſayes <hi>Oremus:</hi> let us pray: as if he ſhould ſay, ſince our Lord is with us, and that he hath ſhewen his mercy and goodneſs in pardoning our ſins, let us now ſettle our hearts to prayer, with confidence, believing that whatſoever we ſhall ask, by vertue of this Sacrifice we ſhall obtain; Now becauſe this <hi>Dominus vobiſcum</hi> and <hi>Oremus</hi> do frequently occur in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of them in the next Paragraph.</p>

This Salutation may be taken diverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: In a demonſtrative way it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports our Lord is with you. In an optative ſenſe, it is as if he ſhould ſay, I wiſh that our Lord may be with you. In a Monitive way, it ſerves to admoniſh us of our Duties in the preſence of God. In the Firſt ſenſe, our Lord is ſaid to be with us in the <hi>Maſſe;</hi> for he is there in a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner really and truly here on the Altar.

                  <p>Some Interpreters of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> do ſay, that this kiſs of the Altar here ſignifies the Reconciliation, which Chriſt offered to the Jews by his Paſſion: others, that it ſignifies the Union of the Church to Chriſt Jeſus: others, in token of our Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33751:94"/>to God, by the Incarnation of his only Son. From whence comes the kiſs of Charity or love to God, and our Neighbour, and all the World; and from thence comes the kiſs of peace, that is, as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> has it; <hi>Tranquility of Conſcience, which brings a confidence in God's mercy, and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders peace with our Neighbours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> having put on her Royal Garments, entered into the preſence of King <hi>Aſſuerus:</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to him ſhe kiſſed the top of his Rod or Scepter: and ſo made her Succeſsful petition for the people. I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to ſpeak of the Charity and peace: here only that the Prieſt going to the Altar, kiſſeth it in token of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to God: but the example of <hi>Eſther</hi> is more proper to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for as ſhe went with fear and trembling, in her Royal Garments, to enter unto the King; So the Prieſt cloathed in Robes, and Garments purpled with the blood of Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> enters with fear of unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſad memory of his Sins,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33751:95"/>and Iniquity: which have been the ſubject of his prayer hitherto; yet now he goes to the Altar, and with profound Reverence, intending thereon to pray for the people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giving them aſſurance that they are reconciled to God.</p>
                  <p>Here the faithful may make their intentions to go in ſpirit along with the Prieſt, in this Holy action: and piouſly with humble Reverence bow their heads to the Altar, whereon Chriſt is to be offered.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt go from the middle of the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The natural reaſon is to go to the Book; which lyes on that ſide of the Altar, there prepared for him; but the Myſtical reaſon is, that he goes to the right part of the Altar, to wit, that part which is on his right hand; to ſignifie that the <hi>Emanuel</hi> promiſed in the Law, was to come to the Jews; who then by reaſon of the Divine Law, which they had,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33751:95"/>were on the right part, whereas the Gentiles by reaſon of their Idolatry were on the left.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that the Prieſt ſayes there?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is called <hi>Introit,</hi> that is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance or beginning, for with this the Prieſt enters, or begins the <hi>Maſſe:</hi> to which all that is paſt was but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory. Now in ſaying of this he ſigns himſelf with the ſign of the Croſs, making thereby a profeſſion of his Faith: and arming himſelf againſt the aſſaults of the Enemy; and to ſhew that what he is to do, is to be done in vertue of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Myſtical ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this</hi> Introit?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Some do ſay that it is a Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Symbole, to raiſe the hearts of the aſſiſtants to Devotion; and their voice to devout praiſes, in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating of the Myſtery of Chriſt's Incarnation. So St. <hi>German</hi> takes it, adding, that therefore <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. is then ſaid, to give thanks for ſo great a benefit; others, will have
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33751:96"/>it to ſignifie the Propheſies, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Prophets, and the deſires of the Holy Patriarks and Fathers in Limbo; expecting the coming of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this the more, the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly adds a repreſentation of their Lamentation, and continual Groans and Sighs; by the doleful canticle of <hi>Kyrie Eleiſon,</hi> whoſe often repetition, fitly repreſents their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual prayer, ſo frequently inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means</hi> Kyrie Eleiſon?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the Greek Language, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies as much as Lord have mercy on us, as <hi>Chriſte Eleiſon,</hi> ſignifies Chriſt have mercy on us. The <hi>Grecians</hi> only uſe <hi>Kyrie Eleiſon,</hi> The Latins Thrice <hi>Kyrie Eleiſon,</hi> and Thrice <hi>Chriſte Eleiſon;</hi> and again Three times <hi>Kyrie Eleiſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is it repeated ſo many times?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Grecians</hi> do uſe this <hi>Kyrie Eleiſon,</hi> very often in their Liturgie; in ſome places they have it Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times together, and in other
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33751:96"/>places Twelve times together; the Latin Church by Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s Decree, uſes it only Nine times, in manner as is even now declared, of this we have the example of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanite,</hi> who cryed out <hi>have mercy upon me O Lord;</hi> and continued crying out the ſame, or ſuch like: and in fine, <hi>Lord help me;</hi> So the Two blind in the Goſpel cryed out, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us;</hi> and being rebuked, they cryed out the more, ſaying, <hi>Lord have mercy on us:</hi> And truly if we may, and ought to reiterate our Sighs and Groans for our Sins; why not expreſs the ſame deſires in ſuch effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſweet words, <hi>David</hi> in his Pſalms maketh ſuch Repetitions.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo ſay, that this Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition repreſents unto us the inceſſant cry of the Church; which ſhe pours out for her Children, who ſtand in need of help: many of them little regarding their Souls good; although they are in continual danger, both Spiritually and Corporally: whence compaſſionatly every day and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe cryes out, <hi>Lord have mercy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33751:97"/>upon us, Chriſt have mercy upon us:</hi> for without thy mercy and goodneſs they all periſh, and will be drowned in the water of Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Here we may reflect upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, of the Holy Fathers before Chriſt, for the coming of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> and rejoyce, that he is come to the World, and with a vehement deſire beg that he would vouchſafe to come to our Souls, by his grace: that we may be worthy to receive the fruit of this Holy Sacrifice, to this joyning with the Prieſt in this ſhort, but effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious prayer, <hi>Lord have mercy on us, Chriſt have mercy on us.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> When he has done the <hi>Gloria,</hi> &amp;c. he kiſſes the Altar, in token of the Peace which is given to us, by Chriſt's Nativity: and in Reverence to the Altar, whereon Chriſt is to be Sacrificed; and being to make his prayer, he turns to the People, ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with <hi>Dominus Vobiſcum,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting us to joyn with him therein: we may ſuppoſe, that there is none who comes to <hi>Maſſe,</hi> but that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Prieſt ſhould pray for him, and the Prieſt intends to pray for them; and therefore is willing to put us in mind, that he is now to do it; and for this end he turns to us, and bids us attend thereto: and leſt we ſhould miſtake, he tells us what we are to do; with this <hi>Oremus</hi> Let us pray; come and joyn with me, that is, with the Church, in whoſe name the prayers are made: whence we may gather, how commendable it is that all there preſent, ſhould in heart and affection joyn their Votes, with the Prieſt in ſo powerful a Sacrifice: done by God's Miniſters in the name of the Church; which certainly is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33751:99"/>more Meritorious, and more pleaſing to God, than any private prayers.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are thoſe Prayers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We may conſider their Matter, Form, and end: as for the matter St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes us that <hi>firſt of all things, Obſecrations, Prayers, Poſtulations, and Thanks giving be made for all men,</hi> which words the Holy Fathers do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply particularly to the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> applyes them to ſeveral parts of the <hi>Maſſe;</hi> as is to be ſeen in the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on this place. Others attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them to the diverſity of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are uſed in the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Four ſorts of Prayer; for the Church in theſe Prayers, ſometimes makes Supplication to be delivered from Evils: as in time of perſecution, or other afflictions or Temptations. Sometimes prayes for Spiritual gifts and benefits, as of Pennance, Patience and ſuch like; ſometimes alſo makes Poſtulations for ſome particular favour, as for the Converſion of Sinners, or of thoſe who go aſtray, and to give thanks for benefits received.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:33751:99"/>
                  <p>As for the form of them, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſiders it, will admire the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of God's Church, which has ſo pithily and ſubſtantially, couched in few words all, whatſoever the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may ask of God; however the prayers are ſhort, yet full in ſubſtance and Devotion: for the true practiſe of prayer, is to have a greater heart than mouth, greater Devotion than Tongue, and a full Intention, rather than multitude of words.</p>
                  <p>This doth not derogate in anywiſe, to perſeverance in prayer; for Chriſt prayed whole nights, and in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes, <hi>he prayed longer,</hi> although we read but few words, where fervent Devotion gives Gale, and Grace is Pilot, the Soul may lanch forth, and fail ſecurely; yet ſometimes for order and decency in the Church, and commodity of others, they may, and ought to ſtrike fail; that is, abbreviate their vocal prayer, eſpecially, if by Office or Miniſterial duty it is required: for therein they are not to follow their own proper Devotion: but exactly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:33751:100"/>follow the Rules and Ordinances of their Superiours or Prelates.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the principal thing here intended, is to offer Sacrifice to God; whence it ſuffices to the Church in thoſe prayers to expreſs her intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in few words, in order to the application of this or that <hi>Maſſe,</hi> to ſuch and ſuch ends; So that although the prayers be ſhort in words, yet virtually they extend themſelves to the whole Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving correſpondence with the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es intention, and conſequently is more efficacious than any other private prayer.</p>
                  <p>The chief end of this prayer, is to obtain the deſired effects, by vertue of this Sacrifice: which is for the general good of God's Church, and for what the Prieſt or People preſent, do intend by this <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is this called Collect?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe prayers are ſo called, for that the People are collected or gathered together; or rather for that they are ſaid over them, or, for them ſo collected or aſſembled. Some will
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33751:100"/>have it, becauſe the Prieſt doth col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or gather the prayers, vows or deſires of all there preſent; uniting them in one with his; including in his prayer the Petitions or deſires of all. St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> will give another reaſon, becauſe all who are preſent, may or ought to recollect themſelves, and unite their intentions with the Prieſts in that prayer: It may alſo be ſaid, that they are called ſo, for that ſuch prayers are collected and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Church to be ſaid in the <hi>Maſſe;</hi> and accommodated to the Times, Feaſts, or Subject.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Prayers or Collects do end either expreſly in theſe words, Through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or with others importing the ſame: So <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third ſayes, <hi>We end our Collect through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for we implore the Fathers help and ſuccour for the love of his Son: for Chriſt himſelf has ſaid</hi> Amen, Amen. <hi>I ſay to you, if you ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing in my name, he will give it you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that we have to do, is to joyn
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33751:101"/>our Intentions, or offer up our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in union to the Prieſt's prayers; for as <hi>Durand</hi> notes, <hi>The Prieſt alone ſayes the prayer, whilſt thoſe who are preſent are ſilent, and pray only in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thereby to attend and joyn their hearts, that they may juſtly ſay</hi> Amen. The prayer is not private, but publick &amp; common to all, but performed and preſented by the Prieſt; who makes it in the Churches name, wherefore although People perhaps do not know the words, yet they know the end of the prayers, and for the moſt part know the Concluſion, and can anſwer if they attend <hi>Amen,</hi> as well as the learned.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the Epiſtle?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Holy Scripture is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſaid to be an Epiſtle, for the Divine Books thereof, are as Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or miſſive Letters ſent from God as Teſtimonies of his Sacred Will, unto mankind, for their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; teaching the way to Heaven,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33751:101"/>and how to pleaſe, and ſerve his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty; and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ought to live and dye. In this ſenſe the Church takes the word Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here, for to this end, ſhe ordains ſome ſelected parts of the Scripture to be read to the People, and was uſed in primitive times, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Cathecumens,</hi> and newly converted; we may alſo ſay, that it takes the name of Epiſtle, from the cuſtome of reading, for the moſt part out of the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is the Epiſtle read before the Goſpel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Epiſtle of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> is as I ſaid before, as a miſſive Letter ſent from God by the Pen of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles, to diſpoſe us for the reception of the Goſpel. The Church in this, for our inſtruction in the Myſteries of our Salvation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds according to natures order, from leſs perfect, to more perfect: as God in the Creation did by degrees create the more imperfect Creatures, in order to the perfect knowing of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:33751:102"/>Man, and the Old Teſtament prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the New: whence <hi>Walfride</hi> ſayes, that it is ſo done, that the minds of the hearers might go from leſſer to greater things, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees aſcend from lower things to higher; or as <hi>Cabaſilus</hi> ſayes, to hear the Inſtructions of the Apoſtles, as a diſpoſition to the light of the Goſpel; or as St. <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> ſayes, to the end that the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Goſpel may be better known.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Myſtical, ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It ſignifies the written Law, which went before that of Grace, or the Preaching of St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Preaching of our Saviour; or the labours of the Apoſtles in Converting the Gentiles. In this we may alſo conſider our Vocation to the light of Faith: and give thanks to God as the Apoſtle ſayes, for his ineſtimable gift in ſending his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, and their Succeſſours, to teach us the way of Salvation; that in the end we may with heart
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33751:102"/>and affection ſay, <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> thanks be to God. Which ſaying, St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> did ſo much eſteem, that he ſayes, <hi>what better thing can we bear in mind, or utter from the mouth, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs with Pen, than</hi> Deo gratias? <hi>nothing can be ſaid more briefly, nor heard more joyfully, nothing underſtood that is greater, or done more fruitfully, than</hi> Deo gratias, <hi>Thanks be to God, who has enriched us with the true faith of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Since the Epiſtle is for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, why is it not in the vulgar Tongue?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Thoſe who underſtand the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tongue, may piouſly attend to the Contents thereof: Thoſe who do not, and can read, may find them, as alſo the Goſpels in the latter end of the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Teſtament: and do well to read them over night, eſpecially in the Eves of Sundayes and Holidayes: or in the mornings before they come to <hi>Maſſe;</hi> or if they pleaſe, at <hi>Maſſe,</hi> as I have ſeen ſome Catholicks to do. There are alſo extant in our vulgar Language, books containing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:33751:103"/>expoſitions of the Epiſtles, and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of the whole year: which read over night may much conduce to the encreaſe of Devotion, and Piety. Thoſe who cannot read, may learn of thoſe who can inſtruct them; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Sermons which are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made for their explication; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as I formerly have declared the underſtanding of either of them, is not of neceſſity in order to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and therefore it ſuffices that they know the Myſteries thereof.</p>
                  <p>Where we may note the conſtancy of the Catholick Church, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Primitive times; when for the <hi>Cathecumens,</hi> or the new Converts, or for converſion of Infidels, upon Solemn dayes, ſome part of the Scripture was read, and Pſalms were uſed with expoſitions on them, as is to be ſeen in the Homilies and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, made by the Holy Fathers for that end: now there being no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of expoſitions in order to our faith, and Devotion waxing cold, the Church contents her ſelf with the continuance of the ſubſtantial part,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:33751:103"/>remitting the expoſitions thereof, to Sermons and Catechiſms, in more commodious time; nevertheleſs, in ſome places the Paſtours, or others for them in high <hi>Maſſes</hi> on Sundayes after the Goſpel do make ſuch, under the name of <hi>Prones,</hi> which our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fickle time will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore ſuffice, that we know by the Epiſtle, the Vocation we have received from God, to the true faith and fulfilling his Will, and Commandements, let us give thanks for that ſo great a benefit, with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by Gods grace, to perſevere faithfully in Chriſt's Law, making progreſs from vertue to vertue inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the Gradual, which in the next ſhall be declared.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That which follows ordinarily, is called Gradual: which for the moſt part, is One or Two verſes of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:33751:104"/>the Pſalms, agreeable to the Office of the day; ſo called from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church in Solemn <hi>Maſſes,</hi> when ſome of the Quire do aſcend to the ſteps of the Quire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Altar; but is alſo properly called a Reſponſe, or anſwer to the Epiſtle; for generally ſpeaking, they have correſpondence to the matter of the Epiſtle, or to the Solemnity of the day; if that be of joy, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſe is ſo too: if of ſadneſs, it is alſo of ſadneſs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doth the Gradual ſignifie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As it is called Gradual, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth our aſcent from vertue to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; or our going up by degrees of Humility, to higher perfection; or rather, the aſcent we ought to make, from the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, to the Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus. It may alſo ſignifie the joy of the Church for the Converſion of Souls, from Idolatry and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme: or to ſee the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners; to ſee the fruit of their Preaching, whereof the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33751:104"/>is a Symbole and the Gradual of the fruit: the Epiſtle is the Field ſown with good Seed, the Gradual the Harveſt.</p>
                  <p>As a Reſponſe, it puts us in mind that we ought in word and work, to anſwer or correſpond to thoſe things, which are propounded in the Epiſtle. And ſignifies, that after St. <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>'s Preaching, repreſented by the Epiſtle, the Diſciples did follow Chriſt in his Evangelical Doctrine, or the Preaching of the Apoſtles after they were called by Chriſt; in fine, it ſerves as a Declaration of the fruit we receive from the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that is, to follow Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means Alleluja?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Our Devout St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> calls it <hi>Canticum honoris,</hi> a Cantile of Honour: which as it hath a hidden ſence in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſo it was never Tranſlated into any other Language; for the <hi>Greek, Latin, Chaldean, Syrian, Arabian,</hi> and all Nations of the Earth do retain it. Whence St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and other Interpreters do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldome Tranſlate it, but leave it
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33751:105"/>as they find it in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaid, that <hi>no Chriſtian is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Alleluja is a voice of praiſe;</hi> Indeed the word divided imports as much, but as connexed together, according to the uſe of the Hebrews; it ſignifies not only praiſe, but praiſe with joy and gladneſs; beyond what can be expreſſed in voice, in fine, this Alleluja is a Sacred and Myſtical word, which the Church Militant uſeth in imitation of the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant; which is ſaid to laud and praiſe God with Joy and Jubilation, and ſing Alleluja, as we may read in <hi>Tobias</hi> Chap. 13. and in the <hi>Appoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Now the Church uſes this Alleluja in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> as correſponding to the foreſaid joy ſhe hath in the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World; or to manifeſt the joy that Chriſtians take in the Solemn Myſteries; which is redoubled in <hi>Eaſter</hi> time for joy of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but from <hi>Septuageſima</hi> to <hi>Eaſter</hi> and ſome other times ſhe omits it, and for the moſt part has a Tract in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:33751:105"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that Tract?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is certain verſes of the Pſalms, appropriated to the times; and is called a Tract, becauſe it is ſung in Solemn <hi>Maſſe,</hi> very leiſurely, with drawing the words and ſillables. <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. gives the reaſon thereof, ſaying; <hi>The Tract with the unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of the Tone, and prolixity, or drawing of the words; does inſinuate the miſeries of our preſent time:</hi> as others ſay it is a protracted voice of mourning mixt with groans, and ſighs, moſt ſutable to the times of pennance; and therefore are well ſaid to be the <hi>Tears of the Church,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to us, the mournful voices, of ſorrow and lamentation due for our ſins and iniquities. It may alſo ſignifie the deſires of the devout Souls, lying and ſighing after the eternal joyes.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that, which is called Proſe or Sequence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Proſe or Sequence, is ſometimes added to the Gradual, as a continuance of the precedent joy or praiſe: The Church uſes Three,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33751:106"/>and thoſe are on the Octaves of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> and on <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day; which Two firſt are ancient, but the Third was made by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine.</hi> Sometimes to the Tract, and that only in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> for the dead; which as the Tract is dolorous, and mournful, is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable. In ſome places, or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders there be more, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>France,</hi> whoſe King <hi>Robert,</hi> out of his piety, did compoſe many: which afterward were uſed in many Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and are to be ſeen in the Miſſals printed there; our <hi>De-burgo</hi> will have it, to ſignifie the Gentiles, who were firſt rejected from Gods People, and afterwards had good cauſe of joy, and exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they were admitted to the grace of the Evangelical Law. It comes properly in this place as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Goſpel, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly follows.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe we have abundant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to imploy our minds, during the time that the Prieſt ſayes thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Tracts, or Sequences; for in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:33751:106"/>them we may conſider the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and care our God has, and alwayes had of our Salvation, to this end, ſending the Prophets to recall his People from their ſins, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Chriſt; to diſpoſe them for the receiving of the true Meſſias, by true repentance of their Sins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may conſider God's great goodneſs, in ſending his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples, for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole World to the Law of Chriſt Ieſus, by their Preaching and Evangelical Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may acknowledge the great benefits we have received in our calling to the light, which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt brought to the World, and how by God's grace we are delivered from the darkneſs of Infidelity and Hereſie, and made Members of the true Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From this we may raiſe acts of Thankſgiving and praiſe, often with heart and voice repeating <hi>Alleluja;</hi> at leaſt ſaying it ſilently with the Prieſt, or in hearing the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:33751:107"/>
                     <hi>Alleluja</hi> we may lift up our Souls, in the Conſideration of the Heavenly joyes, and in praiſing God, ſtrive to conform our ſelves to the Angels and Saints in Heaven, who continually ſing this <hi>Alleluja.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We may at the Tract, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves, to the intentions of the Church: in mourning and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our ſins, or in a longing deſire to aſpire after the Celeſtial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

                  <head>13. Of the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the Goſpel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Goſpel, is ſome part of the Holy Scripture, taken out of the Evangeliſts, which therefore bears the name of <hi>Evangelium,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies good tidings: In Engliſh we call it Goſpel; as Gods ſpell, that is, Gods word or Letter, ſent unto us, out of theſe Evangeliſts: The Church takes its ſeveral Goſpels, for the Time, or Feaſts, thereby to ſhew the Conformity, or Correſpondence of the Goſpel, to the Prophets repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:33751:107"/>in the Epiſtle, which St. <hi>Denis</hi> thus deſcribes: <hi>After the reading,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>of the ancient Law, the New Teſtament is read. The Divine and Epiſcopal Ordination, declaring that the Old Teſtament did foretell the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine works of Jeſus; but the New ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes them,</hi> or declares them as done.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is it read in the</hi> Maſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church ordains ſome part of the Goſpel to be read, for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to ſtrengthen our Faith, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate our hope, and inflame our Souls, with fervent love and burning affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: that ſo we may be the better prepared, to celebrate the Sacred Myſtery of Chriſt's paſſion; and for the greater Reverence of Chriſt's Sacred words: For St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>Amongſt all the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, contained in the Holy Text, the Goſpel does moſt excell,</hi> what the Law and Prophets did foretell, is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted as done, and completed therein. St. <hi>Hierome</hi> calls it the <hi>Breviary, or compendium of the whole Chriſtian Theologie, Doctrine and life.</hi> The
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33751:108"/>Law and Prophets, may be ſaid to be the Goſpel vailed, but the Goſpel is the Law and Prophets revealed. St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> notes, <hi>That of all other Divine Books, we may ſay of the writers, our Lord opened their mouths; but of the Goſpel, our Lord opened his own mouth:</hi> which alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, ſaying, <hi>that diverſly, and many wayes in times paſt, God ſpeaking to the Fathers, in the Prophets: laſt of all in theſe dayes, he hath ſpoken by his Son.</hi> He ſpoke to the Jews by his Servants, but to the Gentiles by his Son.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to hear the Goſpel, is to hear the voice of Chriſt, and we ought to bear as much Reverence to it, as if we were hearing Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaking. So St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> and St. <hi>Anthony</hi> did eſteem it, and ſuch is the intent of the Church, as appears in the Ceremonies, which at this time ſhe uſeth.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are thoſe Ceremonies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the Firſt place, we may note, that the <hi>Miſſal</hi> or <hi>Maſſe-Book,</hi> is removed from the right part of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33751:108"/>Altar, to the left: to ſignifie that Chriſt came not to call the juſt, but ſinners; the right part, repreſents the juſt, and the left ſinners; or rather, as hitherto, the Prieſt did ſtand at the right part, which (as is ſaid former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) repreſents the Jews; now he goes to the left part, which repreſents the Gentiles; to ſignifie that the true Worſhip of God, was firſt amongſt the Jews, to whom Chriſt firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel; but they rejecting and wilfully refuſing it, the Diſciples had command to carry it to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as it is related in the Acts of the Apoſtles, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>To you</hi> (that is to the Jews) <hi>it behoved us firſt to ſpeak the word of God; but becauſe you repell it, behold we turn to the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This done, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church in all times, the faithful preſent do riſe up; and ſtand, during the Goſpel, to ſignifie their willing mind, to receive the Doctrine thereof. The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they heard the Law dictated to them by the Angel, ſtood afar off, with fear
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:33751:109"/>and Reverence; and we Chriſtians do ſtand to hear Chriſt's Law, with Joy and Humility; thereby declaring, that we are ready, in all obedience, to receive and execute, what the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels dictate unto us. Moreover, commonly men riſe up and ſtand when they hear any good Tydings, and thereby manifeſt their greedineſs, or willingneſs to hearken thereto So we ſtand up with a greedy and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent mind, to hear the Evangelical Tydings of joy, and conſolation; thereby alſo manifeſting our promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to fulfill what ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or commended therein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may conſider with what Humility and Devotion the Prieſt prepares himſelf, for the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel; for going from the right ſide of the Altar, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the middle, he humbly makes prayer, that he may worthily and competently, denounce the Goſpel, with a clean heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When he is come to the Book, he Solemnly pronounces <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus vobiſcum,</hi> to give us notice, that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33751:109"/>he is now to read the words of God, and to move our attention; becauſe our Lord by his word is with us; and to make us more decile, and apt to give ear, to the good Tydings brought unto us, of the Kingdom of Heaven: and for our inſtruction, he names the Evangeliſt, from whom the Goſpel is taken; and in ſaying it, ſigns the Book with the ſign of the Croſs, to ſignifie that the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the work of our Redemption, or that by the Croſs we have received the benefit of the Evangelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Prieſt alſo ſigns his forehead, mouth and breaſt, with the ſame ſign of the Croſs: on his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, to manifeſt his faith on his mouth and his breaſt, to intimate the charity or love of his heart; by ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his forehead, he recalls his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory from all other things; by ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mouth, he expells all other thoughts from his heart, from whence the mouth ſpeaks; by ſigning his breaſt, he purifies by vertue of the Croſs, the affections of his will.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33751:110"/>Again, he imprints the Croſs on his forehead, to ſhew that he is not aſhamed to profeſs the Goſpel, but would have all to know, that he is a ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus, and a lover of the Croſs: he alſo ſeals his mouth or lips, mentally, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will confeſs to our Lord, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly with my mouth: and in the midſt of many I will praiſe him,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his Holy Goſpel: and laſtly, he ſigns his breaſt, to declare that what he profeſſes, and declares with his mouth, that he believes in Heart and Soul.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We may conſider, how Reverently the Prieſt ſtandeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Book, with joyned hands, bowing his Head, in the beginning, and end, as alſo at the Holy name of Jeſus. Laſtly, he kiſſes the Miſſal in token of Reverence to Gods word; or as a gage o promiſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance thereof; and then briefly prayes, that the Evangelical words, may take effect in his Soul. In all which we may ſee, the great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that the Church of God, has
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33751:110"/>alwayes had to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But what are we to do then?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Standing devoutly, as is ſaid before, we receive the Prieſt's Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, anſwering, <hi>Et cum ſpiritu tuo;</hi> intimating that they are attentive to what he is to read; and when he ſayes, <hi>Sequentia Sancti Evangelij,</hi> &amp;c. We make Reverence, by bended knee or bowed head, or both, towards the Altar, and with a joyful and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acclamation, ſay, <hi>Gloria tibi Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> Glory be unto thee O Lord: ſigning our ſelves after the example of the Prieſt, and for the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, on the forehead, mouth, and breaſt, of which we have now ſpoken; all which we may apply to our ſelves; and in like manner bow at the Sacred name of Jeſus. When the Prieſt has ended the Goſpel, we ſay, <hi>Laus tibi Chriſte:</hi> Praiſe be to thee O Chriſt; to give thanks and praiſe to Chriſt, who revealed this his word unto us; and with humble ſubmiſſion, and bended knee, as in the beginning, in like manner ſigning
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33751:111"/>our ſelves on the forehead, profeſſing our ſelves to be ready to perform what is declared unto us; on the mouth, making it known to others; and on the breaſt, to conſerve and keep, what they have learned and heard, in their hearts and minds.</p>
                  <p>We may reflect on the great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, of thoſe who heard our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Preaching, and Teaching the People, and imitate the example of theſe, who followed him, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, in all his works. We may alſo call to mind Chriſt's ſentence, <hi>Every one that heareth theſe my words and doth them, ſhall be likened to a wiſe man that built his Houſe upon a Rock; and every one that heareth theſe my words and doth them not, ſhall be like a fooliſh man that built his Houſe upon the Sand:</hi> and then remember the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That we ought to obſerve thoſe things which we hear.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Goſpel is the Code of Chriſt's Law, and the Creed, is an Abridgment thereof, or a ſhort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our belief thereto: The Goſpel is a publick Proclamation, or Declaration of Chriſt's Doctrine; and the Creed is an acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by which we manifeſt with heart and mouth, that we profeſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Doctrine and Law of Jeſus Chriſt; and is congruouſly ſaid in this place; for beſides that, it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Faith, which is required to the better performance of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which the Holy Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call the <hi>Myſtery of Faith:</hi> it is alſo a Hymn of Divine praiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with heart and mouth we give thanks to God, for the benefits we have received by his Holy Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Durand</hi> ſayes, that the Creed doth aptly follow the Goſpel, to ſhew that we receive the Evangelical word or Preaching, which we manifeſt by effect. The Symbole after the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Faith after Preaching, according to the words of St. <hi>John,</hi> when he
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33751:112"/>ſpoke theſe words, many believed in him. Finally, as the Goſpel does ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Chriſt's Preaching and Teaching; ſo the Creed doth repreſent the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the World to the Faith of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Do the People ſtand or kneel at the Creed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Durand</hi> affirms, that all ought to ſtand, becauſe it is all one with the Goſpel, or the principal heads of the Goſpel; certainly there is as much reaſon for ſtanding at the Creed in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> as at <hi>Benedictus, Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, nunc Dimittis:</hi> as the general cuſtome of the Church Teaches us, in the Divine Office; as alſo at the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and at St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, which are but Canticles of praiſe, &amp; as profeſſions of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this poſture of ſtanding, ſhews a promptitude, and readineſs of mind to put in execution, what is propounded in the Creed; which is Myſtically commended unto us by St. <hi>Paul, Stand therefore, having your Loyns girded in Truth:</hi> that is, ſtand ye conſtant in Faith, in oppoſition to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33751:113"/>all Hereſies, believing with all inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; whatſoever the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds unto you, let your life cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond thereto, by Chriſtian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, with conſtancy and firmneſs of mind, walking before God and Man uprightly, according to the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>I know the <hi>Rubricks</hi> will have us to kneel in private <hi>Maſſes,</hi> excepting only the Goſpel, and therefore all may do ſo; nevertheleſs, becauſe as <hi>Durand</hi> ſayes, the Creed is all one with the Goſpel, and that the <hi>Rubricks</hi> do only ſpeak of private <hi>Maſſes,</hi> in which the Creed is ſeldome ſaid, it ſeems to me that the poſture of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more proper at that time.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt kneel down at</hi> Homo factus eſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not only the Prieſt as <hi>Gaventus</hi> ſayes, doth kneel then, but alſo all others preſent, even as they do at <hi>Verbum caro factum eſt;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the ſame thing: for God was made Man, and the Word was made Fleſh, they differ only in terms, both expreſſing the Incarnation, which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:33751:113"/>was the beginning of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The words being full of Majeſty and Reverence, expreſſing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt condeſcention of the Diety, to our Humanity imaginable, which do challenge the greateſt Humiliation Man can make to God, who by it has exalted Man to the greateſt Dignity he is capable of; with great reaſon, therefore at the pronouncing theſe words, all ſhould in heart and action kneel down in all Humility, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging ſo great a Grace.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt at the end of the Creed croſs himſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As well to arm himſelf againſt the Devil, who by his Temptations ſeeks all means to make us ſtagger in our Faith; as to ſeal this Faith in his heart and mind; as alſo to ſhew that for the profeſſion of this Faith, he is ready to ſuffer and dye with Chriſt Jeſus on the Croſs; which is fitly done at the words <hi>Vitam aeternam,</hi> life everlaſting; which by the Croſs and Paſſion of our Saviour he hopes to attain.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why ſayes he here Amen?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:33751:114"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Amen;</hi> in this place, is ſaid by the Prieſt, in the name of all who are preſent, thereby making a Ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and confirmation of the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before niade; as if he ſhould ſay, verily, truly and certainly; without any doubt or heſitation, I believe all, and every Article of this Creed; and am ready to confeſs it before the whole World; for I hold all to be moſt true, moſt certain and infallible, ſince Chriſt, who is <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithful and true witneſs, has teſtified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who underſtand the Latin Tongue, may read it ſilently to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or attend to the Prieſt reading it; and thoſe who do not, may do well to ſay the poſtles Creed, which from their Infancy they were taught; calling to mind that as they received their Baptiſm, by this profeſſion of their Faith, ſo alſo it is requiſite that they make the ſame, before they are to be admitted to this Holy Sacrifice; particularly if they be to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; for only the faithful are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and only ſuch are admitted, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33751:114"/>receive the benefit thereof: Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a neceſſary diſpoſition thereto: wherefore with a fervent faith, they may rehearſe the ſame Creed, which in ſubſtance is all one with that, which the Prieſt ſayes; or if we will, we may in Spirit, make general acts of Faith in conformity to what the Prieſt ſayes, in heart and mind, if not in mouth, ſay, <hi>I do believe, Lord help my incredulity.</hi> I believe whatſoever thou haſt ſaid or done; I believe whatſoever thy Church Teaches: Thou O Lord help my frailty, and confirm this Faith in me, wherein I hope to live and dye, and in token thereof, I ſign my ſelf with the Croſs.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Offertory, ſignifies only the actual Oblation, of what is to be offered in this Sacrifice, which here begins, and in more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is expreſſed, although continued in the moſt part of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Now, the Prieſt before he begins it, firſt kiſſeth the Altar out of Reverence; and turning to the People, Salutes them with <hi>Dominus vobiſcum;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wiſhing, that our Lord may be preſent with them, directing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring their hearts, to joyn with him in all Devotion and Reverence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c ming ſo great a Sacrifice; and turning to the Altar, he ſayes <hi>Oremus;</hi>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that which he ſayes after this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This is that which in the Miſſal is called <hi>Offertorium,</hi> becauſe it begins the Offertory, or Oblation, and is ſome ſentence taken, out of the Pſalms moſt commonly; and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Hymn our Saviour did ſay, before he went to the <hi>Mount-Olivet,</hi> where he made his firſt Oblation; or the Admonition of our Saviour to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Sit yee here, till I go yonder and pray;</hi> for virtually the Prieſt invites the People to ſtay in Spirit, praying, whilſt he goes to prepare all things for the future Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: and therefore he ſayes that verſicle, repreſenting the words of our Saviour, <hi>My Soul is ſorrowful even to death, ſtay here and watch with me:</hi> which words our Saviour ſpake before he begun his paſſion: in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33751:116"/>thereof, the Church uſes this Offertory, as an Anthem to begin the repreſentation of Chriſt's paſſion; and that we ſhould abide in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, of the following Myſteries, and carefully attend thereto.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What is the Oblation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Oblation is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and is one of the chiefeſt actions, belonging to the Function of Prieſthood, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Every High Prieſt taken from among Men, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Men, in thoſe things that pertain to God, that he may offer gifts and Sacrifices for Sin;</hi> and in this place ſignifies the action of the Prieſt, now beginning to offer Sacrifice to God, wherein he offers Bread and Wine according to Chriſt's Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in order to the Conſecration.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>For whom doth the Prieſt make this Oblation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In this place he offers alſo the whole ſubſtance and action of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> to God the Father, for the whole World; but particularly, he Firſt offers it by manifeſting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33751:116"/>for himſelf; that God would be pleaſed to take away his Sins. Secondly, He offers it for all preſent with him at this Sacrifice, who are more particularly participant thereof; and then for all the faithful living and dead. Laſtly, He prayes that this Oblation may be profitable, both to him and them, in order to their Souls health and comfort, which may bring them to life everlaſting; And this not only in the Oblation of the Hoſt, but alſo in that of the Chalice.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why are theſe Oblations made apart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church in this, follows the action of our Saviour, who firſt took Bread, and then Wine; now although each of them, do repreſent the ſame Body and Blood of Chriſt; yet the ſpecies are different, with a diverſe way of ſignification, and are alſo different in the acts of Conſecration; they have a different Oblation. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> explicates it thus, although there be Two ſpecies, yet not Two Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for the Unity of the word of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33751:117"/>Chriſt Jeſus, make the Unity of the Sacrifice; ſo that theſe Two Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do make but one total Oblation, of one thing ſignified thereby, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, who gave his Body and Blood under Two ſpecies, for the more compleat ſignification of his paſſion, where the Blood was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Body.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doth this action of Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſignifie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If we conſider it as a particular action in this place, it may repreſent the preparation, which the Diſciples made for the laſt Supper, for it is but a preparative diſpoſition to the act of Conſecration; and Myſtically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Oblation, which Chriſt made of himſelf to his Father in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p>In this time of the Oblation, we ought to offer our ſelves, our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vows, and deſires, uniting them to the Prieſt's Oblation, which is as well ours as his. The Prieſt, indeed, by reaſon of his Dignity, has the Miniſtery thereof; but the Action is ours alſo, as done in our names, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:33751:117"/>on our behalf, and for us; the Effects are equal to us, and to the Prieſt, equally imparted to each one; nay, many times the effects of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> may be gained by us, when the Prieſt gains little, or none at all, by reaſon of ſinful indiſpoſition in his Soul; for that this Action or Oblation, may be meritorious to us, and not to him: however we may make it by the Prieſt, as from our ſelves, or by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his action, and addreſſing our intentions therein, as he on his part does unite his to ours.</p>

                  <head>2. Of ſeveral things, which occurr in this Oblation of the Sacred Hoſt.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the Ceremonies, which the Prieſt uſes in the Oblation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe this Oblation does Myſtically repreſent unto us, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which Chriſt made in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, we may conſider in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, many circumſtances of what Chriſt did then do; wherefore.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, after the Offertory, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33751:118"/>Prieſt takes the Vail off from the Chalice, to ſignifie unto us, that Chriſt going into the Garden, begins to diſcover his paſſion to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which formerly he had but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely foretold. The uncovering of the Chalice, may alſo repreſent the unvailing the Old Law, which before was hidden in Figures and Types; whereas now the New Law or paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was manifeſted and diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By removing the Chalice and Patten from the Corporal, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto us, the ſeparation which Chriſt made of himſelf from his Diſciples, that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſe himſelf, to begin his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make an Oblation thereof to his Father.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Prieſt takes the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and Hoſt, which may repreſent Chriſt's Second ſeparation, from the Three other Diſciples, whom he had taken from the reſt, when he made the forementioned Oblation.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Pray Sir, what means the Patten and Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> I have ſpoken already of them
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33751:118"/>in the Firſt part, ſo that it is needleſs here to repeat, what has been ſaid there.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why then is the Hoſt or Bread here to be offered, round?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As for the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, it imports not what form it is, provided that it be true Whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Bread. In the Eaſtern Church, this round form is not ſo much uſed; nevertheleſs, the Latin Church has alwayes uſed it ever ſince the time of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Firſt, who lived in the year 106. and others do ſay, that its beginning is unknown; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there are very congruous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it. For firſt, The round form puts us in mind that Chriſt is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and end of all created things; yet in himſelf without beginning or end, as the round form repreſents. Secondly, In ſign that Chriſt our King, being to offer himſelf on the Croſs, did bear a Crown of Thorns, and with his Doctrine filled the round Earth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Diſciples to leave no Corner of the Earth without Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:33751:119"/>And as he dyed for the World, ſo he left this Sacrament for all the Inhabitants thereof. Thirdly, This Form, or Figure, is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and moſt beautiful of all Forms, and therefore moſt proper for the moſt excellent of all Sacraments. Fourthly, God made the noble bodies of the World round, and the Church ordains this Wafer to be round, that it might repreſent the moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrament. Finally, it is made in the manner of <hi>Mony,</hi> myſtically, to ſignifie unto us, that the Bread of life, Chriſt Jeſus, was betrayed and ſold for <hi>Mony:</hi> as alſo that Chriſt on the Croſs, was the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and ſo may repreſent the penny, or reward, which was given to the Laborours in the <hi>Vineyard;</hi> for this Holy Sacrament is called the pledge or price of Eternal glory.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is it made ſo thin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> With great reaſon; for thereby we may eaſily ſee, that there is no mixture or filth in it; and that it is pure Bread, made of clean Corn; whereas if it were thicker, there
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:33751:119"/>might be other things therein, not capable of Conſecration, or filth not beſeeming ſo great a Sacrament: herein alſo we may note, the great care of God's Church, leſt any Crums or reliques of the Hoſt ſhould be ſcattered, or let fall on the Altar or ground, which would after happen in other forms of Bread; and for theſe reaſons, alſo the Wine is Conſecrated in a ſmall quantity, leſt any effuſion ſhould be made thereof.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is it in unleavened Bread?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is no neceſſity, in regard of the Sacrament: for the <hi>Grecians</hi> do celebrate in leavened Bread, but in the Weſtern parts they did alwayes uſe Azime or unleavened Bread, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, believing that Chriſt did uſe the ſame in his laſt Supper, as it was prefigured in the Jewiſh Azime or Bread of prepoſition: <hi>Durand</hi> notes, that the Church received this rite from St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> and as <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> affirms it to have been alwayes the cuſtome of the Church; the Leaven ſignifies corruption, and the Azime ſincerity,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33751:120"/>as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, and the whiteneſs of the Hoſt is a ſign of purity.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Have you any thing more of the Ceremonies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, the Prieſt having made the Oblation, with the Hoſt on the Patten, makes the ſign of the Croſs, to ſignifie unto us, that the Oblation has its effects from the Croſs or paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt; which he then voluntarily accepted for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; this being done, the Prieſt layes down the Hoſt on the Corporal, to repreſent that our Saviour fell flat on the ground; as leaving himſelf to his Fathers will, yeilding his Body to the Sacrifice of the Croſs; as the Prieſt layes the Hoſt down, as matter ordained for the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Prieſt puts or hides the Patten under the Corporal, to ſignifie that the Diſciples fled from their Maſter, now expoſed to the paſſion, and hid themſelves; nevertheleſs, there remains a little part uncovered, which repreſents our Bleſſed Dady, and St. <hi>John Evangeliſt,</hi> who never
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:33751:120"/>left our Saviour, but continued with him even to the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ceremonies duly conſidered, may move our Souls to Devotion, and make a good preparation, for the better attention, to the following myſteries; we may do well here to joyn our prayers, to the prayer which our Saviour made in the Garden; and in union thereof, to offer up our ſelves to God, with a purpoſe never to ſeparate our ſelves from him, but to follow him even to the Croſs.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> The Church has alwayes done ſo, and it is generally held to be an Apoſtolical Tradition, and many are of opinion, that our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his laſt Supper, did mingle Water with his Wine; So St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> expreſly declares. Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> Anno 106. tells us, <hi>That in the Sacrifice of the</hi> Maſſe, <hi>only Bread and Wine mixt with Water is to be offered. In the Chalice of our Lord, neither Wine alone, nor Water alone, ought to be offered, but both mixed; for we read that both did flow from Chriſt's ſide in his paſſion.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reaſon for it. <hi>When the Water is mingled with the Wine in the Chalice, the people are united to Chriſt Jeſus, and the multitude as believers, are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, and joyned to him, in whom they believe. This mixture, or conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Water and Wine in our Lord's
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33751:121"/>Chalice, is ſo done, that this conjunction cannot be ſeparated, to ſignifie, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſeparate the Church from Chriſt;</hi> afterward he ſayes, <hi>Water cannot be offered alone, nor Wine alone; for if any one offers Wine alone, the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt begins to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us; and if Water alone, the people begin to be without Chriſt: but when the one and the other be mingled, and by a confuſed mixture or union, they are blended together; then the Spiritual and Heavenly Sacrament is perfect</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the mixture of Wine and Water, is an expreſs Symbole of the union, which Chriſtians have with Chriſt in this Sacrament: which is the fruit principally intended in this Sacrifice. This mixture alſo aſſures us, that Chriſt is united to us, and we to him, by this Euchariſtical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; intimating that our Salvation cannot be without the participation of Chriſt's blood, nor the effuſion or offering of his blood, without our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt bleſs the Water, and not the Wine?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:33751:122"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Wine, as is ſaid, doth ſignifie him who needs no Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and the Water, the People who ſtand in need of Benediction; and therefore the Prieſt Bleſſes the people in the Water, for a diſpoſition to the union which by this Sacrifice we are to make to Chriſt. In the <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the dead, this Benediction is not given, for the Souls in Purgatory are in the ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt put ſo little Water?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That it may the ſooner be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Wine, for it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the Water be converted into Wine, and not the Wine into Water, to ſignifie that we are to convert our ſelves to Chriſt, and that the Church, or People ought to be incorporated unto him. Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> eſteemed it a great abuſe to do otherwiſe, for the People repreſented by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are in no way to be equalized or compared to Chriſt repreſſed by the Wine.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doth he after the Oblation of the Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:33751:122"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He ſets down the Chalice on the Corporal with the Hoſt, and then devoutly prayes, that God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Sacrifice; and withall, begs that the Holy Ghoſt would Sanctifie theſe things, ordained for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſtill in making the ſign of the Croſs, he ſhews that what he asks, is expected by vertue of the Holy Croſs, and paſſion.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration of theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, we may principally inſiſt in the contemplation of the mixture of Water with Wine; or rather the union of our Souls to Chriſt, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents; for it is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal effects of the Euchariſt, of which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that eats my fleſh, and drinks my blood, abides in me, and I in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may alſo conſider the pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Church, which in this Ceremony, manifeſts her intention of uniting us by this Sacrifice to God, in perfect love, and to our neighbours, to the end, that being united as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt to the Prieſt, in the whole courſe of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>

                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt go then to the right end of the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He goes to waſh the tops of his fingers, becauſe then ſuch waſhing is undecent to be done before the Altar; he goes to the end of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, where the Water is prepared for him. <hi>Durand</hi> gives a myſtical reaſon for it, ſaying, <hi>He waſheth alwayes at the right end of the Altar,</hi> the right ſignifies Proſperity, as the left Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; now we offend oftner in Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity than in Adverſity, according to that of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>A Thouſand ſhall fall on this ſide (to wit the left) and Ten Thouſand on thy right hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth he waſh the tops of his fingers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Leſt any Crum or particle of the Hoſt, or any other thing, might ſtick to his fingers, to wit, his thumb and his fore-finger, wherewith only he touches the bleſſed Sacrament, at the Conſecration: This is held to be
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33751:123"/>an Apoſtolical Tradition, whereof St. <hi>Denis</hi> gives this ſignification, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The waſhing is uſed to the tops or extreme parts of the fingers, before the moſt Holy ſigns is obſerved, as if it were before Chriſt, beholding our moſt hidden thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. For thoſe who come to the moſt Holy Sacrifice, ought to be expiated or cleanſed from all imperfections, in as much as they can. St. <hi>Clement</hi> ſayes, <hi>that it is done to ſhew the neceſſary purity of the Soul, and that this Sacrifice ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with all purity of Body and mind.</hi> And St. <hi>Germane</hi> teaches, that, <hi>The Prieſt is admoniſhed thereby, to waſh his Conſcience, with tears of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> And bleſſed <hi>Albert</hi> ſayes, that <hi>The Prieſt wants an ampler waſhing for venial Sins, and reliques of iniquity;</hi> We in ſeeing it may conſider, what purity of Soul and Body is required, in thoſe who come to this Sacrifice, eſpecially to the Holy Communion, and thereby endeavour to cleanſe our Souls, with the Water of contrition, and wipe their Sins away by Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:33751:124"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doth the Prieſt ſay after, in the middle of the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He continues the Oblation, and declares, that the Oblation is made, in memory of Chriſt's Paſſion, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Aſcenſion, which are the great eſſential myſteries of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſubſtance of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the paſſion is our Redemption, the Reſurrection is our life, and the Aſcenſion is our glory. Or Chriſt's paſſion, is the Reſurrection of our Souls; his Reſurrection, the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our bodies; and his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the glorification of both: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he prayes, that this Sacrifice may be accepted for his, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preſent, their Salvation; to which end he challenges the prayers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Bleſſed Virgin and all the Saints. And this prayer may fitly repreſent the extenſion of Chriſt's Oblation in the Garden; for after that our Saviour had made that Oblation to his Father, he proceeds to offer himſelf to the Jews; who came to take him, and carry him to his paſſion; then he ſaid to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33751:124"/>
                     <hi>Ariſe, let us go, behold he approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who ſhall betray me;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>He went forth to meet them;</hi> and leſt they ſhould miſtake, he told them, I am he, to wit, who is to be Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the Salvation of man-kind.</p>
                  <p>In union of the Prieſt's continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oblation, we may do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our intentions, and joyn our Devotions and prayers, invocating the help and interceſſion of the Bleſſed Virgin, St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that this Holy Sacrifice may be accepted before the face of the Almighty God.</p>

                  <head>5. Of <hi>Orate Fratres,</hi> and the <hi>Secreta.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means</hi> Orate Fratres?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Before I go any further, we may note the connexion of this <hi>Orate Fratres,</hi> with the precedent prayer; for the Prieſt having firſt implored the interceſſion of the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that his Oblation may be the more acceptable to God, turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the People, to crave their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33751:125"/>aſſiſtance to the ſame effect; and as ſealing his vows, and deſires, with a kiſs of the Altar, he ſayes, <hi>Orate Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,</hi> Brethren, pray that mine and your Sacrifice, may be acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God the Father Almighty.</p>
                  <p>In which the Prieſt as diffident of his own merits, and knowing that he is corrupted with infirmities, both of nature and ſin; and withall confiding that the prayers of many, are more powerful than any ſingle prayer: for as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayes, it is impoſſible that the prayers <hi>of many ſhould not be heard.</hi> He invites all preſent to joyn with him, in this great work, ſaying <hi>Orate,</hi> wherein he gives three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to wit of Fraternal Charity, Intereſt, and Profit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſalutes them under the title of <hi>Brethren,</hi> which in Scripture; as alſo in common uſe, is a word of Unity, Love and Friendſhip; for the name Brother, intimates a ſtrict-Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Bond of Love, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Whence in the beginning of the Church, Chriſtians did call each other Brothers, to wit in Spirit, for
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33751:125"/>we are all born in the ſame Baptiſm, all have the ſame Father Chriſt Jeſus, and the ſame Mother the Church, wherein, we ought to live, in more love and amity, than if we were of the ſame carnal Parents; The Prieſt then ſalutes all preſent, as Brethren and Children of Chriſt, and deſires them to aſſiſt him by joyning their prayers with him, according to the Obligation of Chriſtian Charity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In ſaying mine and your Sacrifice, he urges them by their own intereſt; as if he ſhould ſay, this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which I am now to make, is yours as well as mine, for it is offered as well for you as for me. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid, that it is offered for many; not for the Prieſt only, but for all. It is the ſame Sacrament, the ſame Grace, the ſame fruit or benefit, that you and I may receive by it, I am but the Miniſter, the ſame thing is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me and by you. The Prieſt indeed is our Proctor or Mediatour, not unlike to him who brings a light or Candel, whereof every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is participant in as full a manner, as he that brings it.</p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:33751:126"/>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that the faithful have great confidence in the Prieſt's pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, eſpecially in this Sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they do very well; but to make it more profitable to them, they ſhould alſo joyn their own prayers, to the Prieſts eſpecially, here where both are profitable by vertue of the Life-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Action; In ſo doing, they many times reap more grace, and ſpiritual profit, than the Prieſt himſelf: nay, it may ſo happen, that he receives little or none at all, and yet thoſe may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Devotion: For the effects of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> depend not on the Prieſt's Goodneſs, or Sanctity, but on what is offered, the Body and Blood of Chriſt Jeſus, in its ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly acceptable; wherefore the Church ordains in this place, that the Prieſt ſhould put them in mind of their duty, teaching them to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Oblation, and here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that they have already done it; otherwiſe it could not be proper to this Sacrifice, though for them, as for all Chriſtian People, our Holy Mother the Church ſupplyes their intentions.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:33751:126"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, He expreſſes the end of this Salutation, to be, that their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be made acceptable to God the Father Almighty, for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; by which he ſummons them to pray with him, that God would be pleaſed to accept and receive the Sacrifice for their Souls good, and for what they intend in hearing <hi>Maſſe. Alcuinus</hi> calls this <hi>Orate Fratres, the union of the Prieſt's prayers and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the prayers and intentions of the People:</hi> that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>with one mind, and with one mouth we may glorifie God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the anſwer to this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A very pious and ſhort prayer; <hi>Our Lord receive this Sacrifice from your hands, to the glory and praiſe of his Holy Name, for our profit, and for the good of all his Holy Church.</hi> In which prayer is the correſpondency to the Prieſt's invitation. For Firſt, We pray, that the Sacrifice may be acceptable, by the Prieſt's Miniſtery, which is all one and from thy hands. Secondly, That the Sacrifice may be
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33751:127"/>to God's glory, and praiſe, which is principally intended therein accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of <hi>St.</hi> Paul, <hi>Do all things to the glory of God,</hi> eſpecially in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Thirdly, That it may be for our profit, ſpiritually and temporally. And Laſtly, That it may be for the benefit of all Chriſtians, yea for the whole World.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Having ſaid Amen, praying God that the Peoples prayers may take effect, he proceeds, ſaying cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prayers ordained by the Church conformable, in number, quality, or ſubſtance, to the Prayers or Collects which are ſaid before the Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why are they read in Secret?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt having invited all to pray, leaves them in that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt he with <hi>Anna</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſpeaks to God in heart, and only moves his lips, his voice not being heard at all: or as Holy <hi>Judith</hi> praying in tears of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, and moving his lips in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and repreſents the prayer of our Saviour, in the Garden, where he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33751:127"/>prayed alone without his Diſciples. All ſhould do well to learn this anſwer which the Clark makes in their name, and ſay it Devoutly in Latin or Engliſh, and praiſing God in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe Holy Women in ſilent prayer.</p>

                  <p>Briefly, The Prieſt advertiſes <hi>the faithful, to have their hearts united with him, and in this important affair, to prepare themſelves with all ſubmiſſive Reverence,</hi> for the Solemn coming of the Son of God in his Humanity and Divinity accompanied with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and therefore cryes out <hi>Surſum Corda.</hi> Ye Souls who ordinarily have your hearts ſet on earth, and earthly things, riſe up and be eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Heaven, going in Spirit to meet the Son of God, who is about to deſcend to you, in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In ſaying, whereof, whereas before he had his hand laid on the Altar, to Symbolize the cares of this World; he now lifts up his hands, and eyes to conform the exteriour Man, to the interiour; for hearts, hands, and eyes muſt be elevated. The heart indeed is principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, for as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſayes, In the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:33751:130"/>
                     <hi>Maſſe</hi> we muſt have our hearts lifted up to God: the elevation of the hands and eyes are as natural expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereof: the hands, as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the future action; and the eyes, as meſſengers to declare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour affections, and intentions of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Whereto we anſwer, <hi>Habemus ad Dominum,</hi> we have our hearts lifted up to our Lord; which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> explicates ſaying, <hi>When the People anſwer</hi> Habemus ad Dominum, <hi>they declare, that they ought not to think of any other thing but of our Lord.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> diſcourſing of this anſwer, ſayes, <hi>O man what doeſt thou do? didſt not thou promiſe to the Prieſt, who ſaid, lift up thy heart, and thou didſt ſay</hi> Habemus ad Dominum; <hi>Art thou not afraid and aſhamed, that in that very time thou art found a Lyar? Good God, the Table</hi> (that is the Altar) <hi>is repleniſhed with myſteries, and the Lamb is immolated for thee; the Prieſt is anxious for thee, the ſpiritual fire guſhes forth from the Holy Table, and thou haſt thy mind on other things. I
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33751:130"/>fear it is too true, that many ſay, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus ad Dominum,</hi> we have our hearts to our Lord, when they have nothing leſs in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Why Gratias agamus Domino?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This follows properly after the Elevation of our hearts to God, when hereby we acknowledge him to be our God, by giving thanks to him for all his benefits, but principally for the Euchariſtical Sacrifice, whence the Prieſt ſayes, Let us give thanks to our Lord God. Whereof St, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> makes mention ſaying, <hi>We give thanks to God, which is the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the Sacrifice of the New Teſtament.</hi> And <hi>St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>Amidſt the Holy myſteries we go to give thanks. And</hi> St <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> Theſe things which belong to the Euchariſt, that is, of Thankſgiving, <hi>all are common, for neither the Prieſt alone gives thanks, but alſo all the People; for Firſt, his voice being received, then they joyn together, that this may be done, meetly and juſtly to receive the Euchariſt. And doeſt thou wonder, that the people ſpeak with the Prieſt, when they ſound out theſe Holy
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33751:131"/>Hymns in common conſent with the Cherubins and ſupernatural powers.</hi> Finally, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thus explicates it. This follows, that for this ſo great a good of raiſed hearts, we ſhould not attribute the glory to our ſelves, as of our own Forces, but give thanks to our Lord; for of this we are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with admoniſhed, becauſe it is meet and juſt.</p>
                  <p>Which is the anſwer we are then to give to the Prieſt, <hi>Dignum &amp; juſtum eſt,</hi> It is meet and juſt; <hi>meet,</hi> becauſe he is our Lord; <hi>juſt,</hi> becauſe we are his people: <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> together, that we his Servants, together with the Prieſt, give thanks to God, from whom we have received all things. <hi>Meet</hi> in reſpect of his manifold bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. <hi>Juſt</hi> in reſpect of our obliged gratitude, for that we are partakers of the Treaſures of his mercy, in this holy Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh that each one, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their Souls, would conſider theſe words, and learn them either in Latin or Engliſh; that with heart and mouth they might anſwer to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33751:131"/>Prieſt, for if they did, I am confident great Comfort and Devotion would ariſe thereby. The words are ſhort, but full of Energie and Vertue.</p>

                  <head>7. Of the Preface.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What ſay you of the Preface?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Thoſe who underſtand Latin, may do well, to attend to the Preface, which ſavours of much Piety, and yields abundant matter of Devotion; for thoſe who are ignorant thereof, I will draw the moſt conſiderable motives for their Devotion; and for this end, I ſhall divide it into Five Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Conſideration is, that the Prieſt confirms, the anſwer which we make, concerning our giving thanks to God: telling us, verily it is <hi>Meet and Juſt, Right,</hi> and <hi>wholeſome</hi> to do ſo; <hi>Meet,</hi> for the benefits here propounded; and <hi>Juſt,</hi> for God made Man, by this Euchariſt here commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his goodneſs and mercy; <hi>Right,</hi> for its weight, and merit; <hi>wholeſome,</hi> as the cauſe of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33751:132"/>or <hi>Meet,</hi> becauſe he is good; <hi>Juſt,</hi> becauſe he is beneficient; <hi>Right,</hi> becauſe he is merciful; <hi>wholeſome,</hi> becauſe he is our Souls Medicine. Again, <hi>Meet,</hi> becauſe out of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and pleaſure, he has created us; <hi>Juſt,</hi> becauſe out of pure goodneſs he has Redeemed us; <hi>Right,</hi> becauſe he has freely and <hi>gratis</hi> juſtified us; <hi>Wholeſome,</hi> becauſe he has predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to glory; and he invites us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to praiſe God, by declaring that he is our <hi>Holy Lord, Omnipotent Father, and Eternal God;</hi> for all San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity comes from him, and by his power alone this Sacrifice was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, whoſe fruit is Eternity; and then tells the means to do it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Conſideration is, that the Angels, and all the whole Court of Heaven do adore, and with mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al concord and conſent, by inflamed layes of Charity, do celebrate God's praiſe, and glory; this the Church propounds unto us for imitation, for if theſe Heavenly Spirits do continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally praiſe God, becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:33751:132"/>in his preſence. The Church inſinuates thereby the great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Adoration, and Honour, we ought to give to our God in the Holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt; which if we do, all theſe ſupernal Spirits will help us, in this action: that as they perpetually rejoyce in God by inflaming Love, ſo we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and exult with ardent love of him, who has manifeſted his infinite love to us in this Holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may conſider, that the Church Militant deſires to joyn with the Church Triumphant; to make one Quire, and the faithful people preſent, knowing their own frailty and indignity; make humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that God would give them Grace, to make them worthy to make a part with the Heavenly Quire, in this holy Sacrifice, for as <hi>Florus</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Holy Church is to be aſſociated to the Quires of Angels, and with the Angels perſiſt, in the praiſes of God for ever and ever. And now in this holy Sacrifice,</hi> as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> teaches, The Angels are ready to joyn with
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33751:133"/>us; at that time ſayes he, <hi>The Angels accompany the Prieſt, and the whole Orders of Celeſtial powers cry out; the whole place near the Altar, in his honour who is there immolated, is full of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Quires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may devoutly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how the Church here ſpecifies the Song or Canticle, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels continually ſing in Heaven; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> and St. <hi>John Evangeliſt,</hi> by the Greeks called <hi>Teiſagion,</hi> a thrice holy Canticle; that is, <hi>Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Hoſts, all the Earth is full of thy glory.</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> affirms, that we cannot give to God, a more precious Title, or more ſutable to his Glory, than to call him Holy; for it is to ſay in one word, all the ſubſtantial and incomprehenſible perfections of his Deity: and by this term holy in this place, we underſtand God to be the Abiſs of Sanctity; from whence Angels and Men participate all their Sanctity, as the Sun beams receive light from the Sun. As therefore the Seraphins and Angels do thrice
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:33751:133"/>repeat this Holy, ſo ought we in this place: for as St. <hi>Damaſcene</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Deity is thrice declared</hi> Holy and Glorified, when <hi>Sanctus,</hi> or Holy is ſaid three times; whence <hi>Procopius</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Seraphins do not only once ſing the praiſes of God,</hi> but reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them often, yea infinite times. For by the number of three, we may underſtand a multitude; ſo that by ſaying, that they ſing holy three times, we may take it all times; for this is their continual ſong, whereto we hope to add our parts with them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as they joyn with us in this holy Sacrifice; wherefore it is added <hi>Lord God of Sabaoth,</hi> which is one of the names the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did give to God, and is not Tranſlated in the Latin Church, for that the word <hi>Sabaoth</hi> is an exceeding expreſſion, in any other Language; but by many it is interpreted, <hi>Lord God of Hoſts, or Armies:</hi> which is fitly ſaid here, for in theſe words both Angels and Men do make Homage to their God, acknowledging him for their Lord, with this Canticle, wherein the Hoſt,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:33751:134"/>or Army of the Celeſtial Spirits, and the Hoſt or Army of Chriſt's Church, at this time made one, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Army of a Camp ſet in array: do joyntly, and in due order, Praiſe, Magnifie, and adore God: whence conſequently it is ſaid, all the Earth is full of his Glory, the Heavens are full of it already, now it is fitting that the Earth alſo ſhould be full of the ſame, all Men on Earth ought to ſing his Glory, even as the Angels do in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth conſideration may be of the Hymn, which St. <hi>Mathew</hi> relates when the multitude that went before, and followed, cryed, ſaying <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> bleſſed is he, that comes in the name of our Lord, <hi>Hoſanna in the Higheſt,</hi> which are the ſame words the Prieſt ſayes here; now ſince Heaven and Earth are to be full of Gods Glory, it is convenient that both Angels and Men ſhould ſing the praiſes of God, as therefore in conjunction with the Angels, we did ſing <hi>Holy, holy, holy;</hi> ſo in this Hymn we invite them to aſſiſt us, or rather
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:33751:134"/>following their example, we ſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hymn or Canticle of praiſe: <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> which ſignifies Triumph, and has a certain kind of exultation and joy, <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> or praiſed be he that comes in the name of our Lord; <hi>Bleſſed</hi> be he, who by his infinite goodneſs came into the World to Redeem us by his paſſion; in which ſenſe the Prieſt ſigns himſelf with the ſign of the Croſs; <hi>praiſed and bleſſed</hi> be he; who comes to feed us in this holy Sacrament; and Bleſſed be he, who out of his infinite love is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us in this holy Sacrifice; <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> all praiſe, honour, and glory be to God, not only amongſt us on Earth, but alſo in the higheſt Heaven amongſt the Celeſtial Spirits, or in the higheſt manner we can give it.</p>
                  <p>Moved by all theſe Titles and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, let us bleſs and praiſe our Lord with Thankſgiving, imitating the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I will bleſs our Lord at all times, his praiſes are alwayes in my mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us devoutly joyn with the Angels, and all the Celeſtial
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:33751:135"/>Spirits in praiſing and adoring our God, but then we ought to take good heed, leſt any thing be diſſonant on our parts; for if the ſtrings of the heart be out of Tune, or not ſutable to them, our voice will alſo be untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, one jar ſpoils the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; we may alſo reflect, that as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, we are here to <hi>ſing to our Lord in the ſight of Angels,</hi> and that not only in their ſight, but we are to unite our hearts and voyces with them, and that in the preſence of God; and withall, we take their own words, for as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayes. <hi>We now praiſe God on Earth, with the ſame voices or words, wherewith the Holy Angels do praiſe him in Heaven; not by pride of preſumption, but by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hearing the Seraphical and Cherubical Hymn, Holy, holy, holy, we ought to raiſe our minds, to praiſe the bleſſed Trinity, and with all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence adore, and tremble before ſo great a Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may reflect on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Children, who prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:33751:135"/>our Lord as he was coming to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where afterward he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his paſſion and Death; And think with our ſelves, that with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon, we ought to rejoyce and praiſe our Saviour, who now comes to apply unto us his paſſion, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, and here in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſtrew their Garments in the ways, and cut boughs from the Trees, and ſtrew them in the way; and ſhall not we with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Reverence, expect and attend the coming of our Saviour, though in an inviſible manner? ſhall we not caſt our Veſtments, that is our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with all external Reverence poſſible? and above all carry the boughs and branches of interiour Devotion, and Piety, that in true faith, lively hope, and inflamed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in Tranquillity of Spirit, we may be prepared for the coming of our Lord, or to meet our God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But why is there a litte Bell rung at this time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is, and has been a cuſtome
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:33751:136"/>among Catholicks, to ring a little Bell, and in Catholick Countryes to ring out the great Bell, when the Prieſt ſayes <hi>Sanctus,</hi> or to make ſome other ſign, as by Mallets or Wooden Hammers, as on <hi>Good-Fryday;</hi> or by cryes, or by ſinging <hi>Alleluja,</hi> whereof <hi>Baronius</hi> makes mention; to give warning to the faithful of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn action: to the end that in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner they may raiſe their hearts to more fervent Devotion, and Reverence. We have a figure of this in the Law, where God ordained little Bells, in the Hem of the Prieſt's Tunick, to the end as the Text ſayes, <hi>That the Sound may be heard when he goes in, and comes out of the Sanctuary in the ſight of our Lord;</hi> which was to move both Prieſt and People to a due Reverence to the Prieſt's Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to an humble Adoration of Gods Majeſty in that Holy place. The Church does uſe here theſe little Bells for the ſame ends, which here in <hi>England</hi> we call <hi>Sanctus Bel.</hi>

                  <p>Q. <hi>WHat means the Canon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Canon is a Greek word, properly ſignifying a Rule, or Order to be obſerved in any thing, we are to do; applyed by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to this part of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> becauſe it is conſtantly obſerved in all <hi>Maſſes</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Churches Order; whence St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls it the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Rule;</hi> and Optatus <hi>a Law or Ordinance eſtabliſhed by the Church.</hi> In the Miſſal, it is called <hi>Action,</hi> which name comes from St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and is ſo called by way of Excellency; for it contains the Conſecration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of our Saviour: and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:33751:137"/>for the ſame reaſon, it is called <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> for in it the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> is principally accompliſhed. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> calls it <hi>Secretum,</hi> a ſecret or private myſtery belonging only to the Prieſt; and St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſayes, that it is called <hi>Canon,</hi> becauſe the Prieſt therein follows the preſcript, and Rule of Chriſt in the Conſecration: and performs his Sacrifice and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in memory of Chriſts paſſion, which in a more particular manner is therein preſented, and expreſſed, in ſigns and actions. It is true, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſecration there are other prayers, and diſpoſitions, or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto, and what follows are but applications of it to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation, ordained for the better repreſentation of the paſſion, as in each particular ſhall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>And here we may note, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Maſſe</hi> be principally ordained, as a repreſentation of Chriſt's paſſion, in whoſe memory it was firſt inſtituted, yet there is in the Canon, a Renovation of Chriſt's
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:33751:137"/>laſt Supper: whence <hi>Durand</hi> notes with Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> 3. That in the Canon, the Words ſignifie one thing, and the Signs or Ceremonies, another; for the words principally belong to the Conſecration of the Euchariſt; but the ſigns principally appertain to the remembrance of Chriſt's paſſion. The words are in order to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Bread and Wine; but the ſigns here before the Elevation in regard of what happened before his Crucifying; and after in regard of what he ſuffered on the Croſs: which Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 1. confirms ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>In the Sacramental Oblations, which are offered amidſt the Solemnity of the</hi> Maſſe <hi>to our Lord, our Lords paſſion is to be mingled, that the paſſion of him whoſe body and blood is made, may be Celebrated or Remembered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe this part of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> which ſolely belongs to the Prieſt, is ſaid all in ſilence, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf to give a general notion of what the Prieſt is then doing, that Chriſtians may apply their Devotion to what occurs in the Canon; and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:33751:138"/>explicate the Signs or Ceremonies therein, that they may alſo have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient matter to meditate on moſt points of the paſſion. Briefly, I ſhall give them ſufficient matter of prayer ſutable to the Prieſt's action; and ſet before their eyes the chiefeſt points of Chriſt's paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Since this is the chiefeſt part of the</hi> Maſſe, <hi>why is it ſaid in ſecret?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> After that the Prieſt by the Preface, has endeavoured to raiſe our minds to the praiſe of God with the Angels, he returns to his former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of offering the Sacrifice, and now wholly applyes himſelf to the chiefeſt action of his function, wherein he alone officiates; and therefore as in the Law of <hi>Moiſes,</hi> the High Prieſt alone did enter into the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum.</hi> So in the New Law, the Prieſt alone performs this action, which concerns the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Oblation of the Holy of Holies, ſubſtantial Sanctity, the true Body and Blood of Chriſt Jeſus God and man; who makes this place far more holy, than the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum.</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:33751:138"/>In fine, it was well ſaid of old: in the Canon, there needs no ears but to God; nor words for the Prieſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, nor ſilence, but to thoſe who are preſent.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Have you no reaſon for it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The cuſtome of the Church, ever ſince the Apoſtles times, might ſuffice any good Chriſtian; but as <hi>Gavant</hi> notes, grave Authours give theſe reaſons for it, <hi>Hugo</hi> a <hi>Sancto Victore</hi> gives his, <hi>for that it is a ſecret Myſtery not to be divulged to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar People:</hi> which <hi>Alcuinus</hi> ſeconds, <hi>leſt the principal words in this Sacrifice ſhould loſe their eſteem.</hi> So that we may ſay, that this manner of ſecrecy, in ſaying theſe words of the Canon, is rather out of Reverence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the myſterial Action or words of Conſecration, and to avoid abuſes which might happen by the vulgar, who hearing thoſe words ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, might turn them to ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane uſe; but the principal reaſon, as I ſaid before, is, becauſe the Prieſt turns his mind wholly to God, with whom alone, he is now to treat: imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:33751:139"/>herein our Saviours ſilence in his paſſion: for although he did then act the work of our Redemption; yet he did it alone, without any to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and was ſilent for the moſt part of his paſſion.</p>
                  <p>We may therefore in ſpirit joyn to the holy Women, mentioned by the Evangeliſts; eſpecially with our B. <hi>Lady,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> who in ſilence, and with hearts full of affection, and loving compaſſion, did attend to our Saviours paſſion: for ſuch ought to be the Devotion of Chriſtians in this time, when the Prieſt in Chriſt's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offers and repreſents the ſame.</p>

                  <head>2. Of the beginning of the Canon.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What ſayes the Prieſt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Canon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> From what hath been ſaid in the Preface, he infers. Therefore as aſſiſted by the Angelical Spirits, makes his humble ſupplication to God, that he would accept of what he is now to do, and give a bleſſing
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:33751:139"/>to his actions; which in a manner is to renew his Oblation, and then ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies thoſe, for whom he is to offer this Sacrifice; which alſo may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us, that as our Saviour free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered himſelf to the Jews, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his paſſion: ſo he alſo offered himſelf to his Heavenly Father, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in his mind, for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man-kind: for we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in all his Torments and Afflictions, his Souls anguiſh, was more for our Souls good; and here with the Prieſt, we may piouſly joyn our hearts and affections, and make our prayer, either mentally or vocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God would be pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this Sacrifice, and hear the Prieſt pray for all hereafter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why immediatly after the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, doth the Prieſt open and joyn his hands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Being to renew his Oblation, he opens his hands after his wonted manner, in ſuch occaſion: he holds up his hands, as now ready to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Function; and then
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:33751:140"/>joyning them, ſhews that he is bound to do God's will, to whom he lifts up his eyes, expecting power and grace from him to perform this Action; in hope whereof he layes his hands on the Altar, and with confidence and aſſurance kiſſes the Altar.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does he make Three Croſſes on the Hoſt and Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt knowing that what he is to do, principally depends on the paſſion of our Saviour; makes the ſign of the Croſs, and that Three times, in order to him, who is Three in one, by whoſe power only the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing work of Conſecration, or Converſion of Bread and Wine, is to be made. Or as Biſhop <hi>Steven</hi> ſayes, to declare that the whole myſtery of this Sacrifice is to be wrought, by the marvellous power of the moſt holy Trinity. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> have the ſame Ceremonies in their Liturgies.</p>
                  <p>But the principal thing we are to attend to, is the myſtical ſignification thereof. The learned Biſhop of <hi>Cambray Odon</hi> in his expoſition of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:33751:140"/>Canon; tells us, that the Three Croſſes do ſignifie the Threefold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of our Saviour. God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delivered his only begotten Son to us, by the Incarnation. <hi>Judas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the ſame to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> delivered him to <hi>Pilate</hi> to be Crucified. Of the Firſt, we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. He ſpared not his only Son, but delivered him for us all. Of the Second, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you. Of the Third, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. They delivered him to <hi>Ponce Pilate.</hi> The Firſt was of Grace, whence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Who loved me and delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for me.</hi> The Second was of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, for <hi>Judas</hi> asketh, <hi>What they would give him.</hi> The Third was of Envy, as <hi>Pilate</hi> judged, <hi>For he knew that for Envy they had delivered him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others will have it, to be in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Threefold Crucifying of Chriſt. Firſt, In the will of thoſe who perſecuted him, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>the chief Prieſts and Phariſees gathered a Council to put him to death.</hi> The Second, In word and voice, when
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:33751:141"/>they cryed Crucifie, Crucifie him. The Third, When indeed they Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him. So that they Crucified Chriſt in thought word and deed.</p>
                  <p>In beholding the Prieſt making theſe Croſſes, we may enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Chriſt's paſſion, and humbly beg, that we may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of its merits: to this end we may ſign our ſelves thrice with the ſign of the Croſs, in Teſtimony that we offer our Souls to God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Bodies before him in this action, and Sacrifice the whole man, to ſuffer with Chriſt according to Gods holy will and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Is there any thing elſe in this Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, the Prieſt prayes that this Sacrifice may be acceptable to God, and profitable to his holy Church in general. And firſt for the Peace, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Protection and Direction of Chriſt's Church: for its Peace, that in peace we may ſerve our God; for its Union, that it may be free from all Schiſms, that it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected againſt all Hereſies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:33751:141"/>by the Holy Ghoſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, For the Pope, whereof we have an example of the Church, praying for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and it has been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtome of the Church, even from the Apoſtles time. Pope <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> 2. affirms it to be <hi>manifeſt, that thoſe are ſeparated and divided from the whole World, who through diſſention do not remember the Apoſtolical Biſhop in the Myſtery</hi> (that is in the <hi>Maſſe) according to the received Cuſtome. Alcuinus</hi> gives this reaſon for it, to wit, that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Charity and Faith of the members with the viſible head of the viſible Church, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to God.</hi> Thirdly, For the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the place, if there be any, for ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us <hi>to remember our Prelates.</hi> Fourthly, For all true believers in general, and eſpecially for thoſe who labour for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Faith, for all Eccleſiaſtical Orders and Miniſters, and Preachers of God's Word: For all who labour for the Converſion of Souls; for all thoſe who out of their liberality and charity, do contribute
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33751:142"/>to the maintenance of the Clergy and Miſſion; and principally for the Converſion of our Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Does he not pray for the King?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He may and ought to pray for the Emperours, Kings, Princes or States, under whoſe Dominion he lives. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us <hi>to pray for all Men, for Kings, and all that are in preeminence;</hi> yea although they be not true Members of the Church, for there were no Chriſtian Kings in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> gives reaſons in the Firſt, to follow Chriſt's command, pray for them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you. Secondly, That ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may become more favourable to Catholicks. Thirdly, That God would direct them in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in Peace and Juſtice, they may rule their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour commends this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of praying, by the prayer which a little before his paſſion he made. <hi>Jeſus lifting up his eyes to Heaven</hi> ſaid, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, that thy Son may glorifie thee;</hi> that is, that his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might take effect, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33751:142"/>of mankind, and be made glorious before the whole World, which would redound to the glory of God the Father. Secondly, He prayes for his Apoſtles and Diſciples, ſaying, Holy Father, keep them in my name; that is, conſerve them in Faith, Grace, and Concord; by thy omnipotent Power and Wiſdome, that they may be conſenting in one Will and Spirit, and Union of charity: He prayes alſo that his Father would preſerve them from all evil; that is, from Sin, or what might draw to Sin; from the Aſſaults and Temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and from all their Enemies both Spiritual and Temporal. Then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his Prayer, he ſaid, Holy Father Sanctifie them in truth: that is San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and make them holy in their Dignity and calling to the Miniſtery of the Word, according to truth and verity. Thirdly, He ſaid, and not only for them do I pray, <hi>but alſo or thoſe who by their word ſhall believe in me,</hi> that they be all one, in the Union of Faith and Charity; agreeing in one Church, and making one Flock,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33751:143"/>or united as Members of the ſame Body in Chriſt Jeſus. Loe here Chriſt going to his paſſion, prayes for the whole Church, for the Prelates and Paſtours thereof, and generally for all Believers, as here in imitation of Him the Prieſt does.</p>
                  <p>And it is our duty to pray for all here ſpecified; for we ought to pray for the Church, which unceſſantly prayes for us: we ought alſo to pray for our Paſtours, who are vigilant over us; duty requires it at all times, and particularly in this palce, our holy Mother the Church challenges it.</p>
                  <p>We are alſo to pray for our King, according to that of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> let us <hi>offer Oblations to the God of Heaven, and pray for the life of the King and of his Children:</hi> or that of Baruch, <hi>pray ye for the life of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and for the life of</hi> Balthaſur <hi>his Son, that their dayes may be as the dayes of Heaven, upon the Earth, and that the Lord give us ſtrength, and illuminate our eyes, that we may live under the ſhadow of</hi>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:33751:143"/>Nabuchadonozor <hi>the King of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>and under the ſhadow of</hi> Balthaſar <hi>his Son, and may ſerve them many dayes, and may find grace in their ſight.</hi> If the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſo devoutly pray for the Kings under whoſe ſubjection they then lived, by much more reaſon ought we Chriſtians to pray for the lives of our natural King, Queen, and their Children; or that they may have Children, that their lives may be long on the Earth, and that God would ſo inſpire them, that we may live ſecurely under their ſhadow and protection, ſerving them according to the duty of Loyal Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ought to pray for our Kingdom or Countrey; for if the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> adviſed the <hi>Iſraelites to ſeek the peace of the City, to which God had tranſported them, and to pray for it to our Lord;</hi> giving a reaſon, <hi>becauſe in the peace thereof, there ſhall be peace to you.</hi> With more reaſon we Chriſtians ought to pray for our native Countrey, City, or place of abode; becauſe the peace thereof is our peace, their good is our good:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:33751:144"/>whence we pray for it, in times of Neceſſity, Wars, Famine, Sickneſs and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We ought to pray for all as true Chriſtians, as they pray for us. St. <hi>James</hi> adviſes us <hi>to pray one for another,</hi> which is here to be done in a more particular manner, according to the intention of the Church, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Communion of Saints. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>whilſt each particular prayes for all: all alſo pray for every one;</hi> the benefit which ariſes thereby is, that the prayer of each one acquires the ſuffrages of all, and each one of the whole Catholick Church.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> The Church requires this of him, as a part of his Function, for it is his office to pray for the People; for God ordained in the Law, that the Prieſt at the Altar ſhould pray for himſelf, and for the People; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here the Prieſt prayes for all, that are preſent at <hi>Maſſe.</hi> It was the office of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Prieſts to pray for the multitude, and by their prayers
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:33751:145"/>God was propitious to them. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt the Evangelical Prieſt's prayers, are more powerful, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they are poured forth in ſuch a Sacrifice, which far ſurpaſſes all other Sacrifices, and therefore ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Faith and Devotion, he here offers this Sacrifice for us.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why for thoſe who offer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I have ſaid formerly, that all preſent, do or may offer this Sacrifice, and therefore, although thoſe who are preſent, in ſome manner are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof, and ſo ſatisfie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Church in days of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; yet they have not ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſpiritual and temporal effect thereof, unleſs they devoutly offer it up with the Prieſt. It was well ſaid by St. <hi>Anthony</hi> the <hi>Abbot,</hi> when one deſired the Saint to pray for him, <hi>How ſhall I pray for thee, when thou doeſt not pray for thy ſelf?</hi> and how ſhall we expect to participate effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Sacrifice, if we do not, when we may offer it for our ſelves?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why for their Friends?</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>Q <hi>Why for their Intentions?</hi>

Whilſt the Prieſt makes this <hi>Memento</hi> (which we know when the Prieſt joyns his hands before his breaſt, as in a Meditation) we may joyn our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; to the ſame intentions, ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mentally the perſons for whom either of Obligation, Promiſe, Duty, or Charity we are to pray; as for our Parents, Benefactors or Friends, we may alſo pray, and offer up this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our Family, or any other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, for which we intend to pray at this time.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What follows this</hi> Memento?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As ſoon as the Prieſt has ſaid the <hi>Memento,</hi> opening his hands he goes forward in the Sacred Action, and as formerly he had called the Angels to his help, and deſired their preſence in this holy Sacrifice; ſo here he invocates the Bleſſed Virgin, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs, and all the Saints to help him in this his Action.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore does the Prieſt here invocate the Saints?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In all ancient Liturgies or <hi>Maſſes</hi> it was ſo, and the Church herein imitates the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and the Children in the Furnace; who conſidering there is no poſſibility to reach praiſes due to God, and knowing their own inſufficiency, did invite the Angels, Saints, and all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Believers; yea all Creatures to praiſe our Lord in all his works; So having formerly invited the Angels, ſo here ſhe invites all the Saints to praiſe God, in this wonderful work of his love and goodneſs, in coming unto us in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but note here Three things
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:33751:146"/>which the Church commends unto us, worthy to be obſerved, to wit, <hi>Communicants,</hi> which preſents unto us the Communion of Saints. The Second is the venerable memory of the Saints. The Third is the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we may have in their merits and prayers.</p>
                  <p>The Communion of Saints, which we profeſs in our Creed, wherein we believe that we have Communion, not only with the faithful on Earth, but alſo with the Saints in Heaven, yea with the Angels. In the Preface we had our Communion with the Angels, here with the Saints, that they may aſſiſt us in God's praiſes; for here is the ſelf-ſame object which they contemplate in Heaven, and that they here with us may praiſe our common God; that ſo the Church Militant, United to the whole Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, may worthily receive their Lord and Maſter, coming unto us in this holy Sacrifice. We may piouſly believe that in this great action of the Conſecration, not only the Angels (as is ſaid before in the Preface) are
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:33751:147"/>preſent, but alſo the Saints accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying their King. For St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>They follow the Lamb whitherſoever he ſhall go.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> infers, <hi>if the Lamb be there, thoſe who are with him, are there:</hi> Never more properly, than in this Sacrifice where the Lamb Chriſt Jeſus is offered; hence it is that the Church here deſires their Communion: For as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Church by her Prieſts, doth not offer this Sacrifice, but in the Communion and Society of the Saints.</hi> Many Expoſiters ſay, we Communicate with the Saints in the Sacrament of the Altar, for what they perceive in Viſion, that we frequent in the Sacramental ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Odo</hi> and others do affirm, that without this Communion of the faithful, and veneration of the Saints, there is no place of offering Sacrifice; wherefore the Church in her Sacrifice Communicates in the memory of Saints. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, inſiſts much in the memory of Saints; as <hi>we erect no Temples, Altar, or Sacrifices to the Martyrs;</hi> becauſe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:33751:147"/>not they, <hi>but their God is our God; we honour their memories, as Gods Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who ever heard the Prieſt at the Altar, that was built up in Gods honour, and the Martyrs memories;</hi> and a little after gives the reaſon, <hi>That we at that Solemnity, may both give thanks to God for their Victories, and be encouraged to endeavour the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of ſuch Crowns of Glory, as they have already attained: ſtill invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating him at their memorials;</hi> and in another place, <hi>we offer only to him, who is both their God and ours. At which offering, thoſe Conquerours of the World, as Men of God, have each one his peculiar Commemoration;</hi> which St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> attributes to their honour; for ſayes he, <hi>It is a great honour to be named in the preſence of our Lord, whilſt we celebrate his death in this dreadful Sacrifice.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, The Prieſt here ſayes, that by the merits and prayers of the Saints, we may obtain grace from God, in this great action, and craves their aſſiſtance and help in the performance thereof. For as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:33751:148"/>ſayes, <hi>We do not make mention or memory of the Martyrs at our Lord's Table, as of others,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But rather to the end, that they may pray for us, and that we may imitate and follow them.</hi> The ſelf-ſame he has in another place, ſtyling it to be according to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Diſcipline; to remember them at Gods Altar, and that it were an injury to pray for Martyrs, to whoſe prayers we ought to commend our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>We may joyn with the Prieſt in craving the aſſiſtance of the B. Virgin and Saints; that we may Devoutly attend, and be made worthy of Chriſt's preſence, and offer up to God what we are here to do, by their merits and interceſſions; ſpecifying if we will; the Saint we are Devoted to, or the Martyr whoſe Feaſt is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, as it was done in the Oriental Church.</p>

So St. <hi>Clement</hi> ſayes, <hi>That the</hi> Maſſe <hi>is a Myſtical:</hi> Latria; <hi>for it offers to God the Father the Type of our Redemption, by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of our Lord's Paſſion,</hi> in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of ſupreme ſervice and Thankſgiving. <hi>Florus</hi> ſpeaking of this place ſayes, prayer is made to God, that he would receive this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which the whole Church offers in ſervice to him alone.</p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:33751:149"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why in ſaying this, doth the Prieſt extend his hands, over the Hoſt and Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſpreading of his hands carries with it, a ſubmiſſion of his action, to the Divine power; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thereby, that he wholly depends thereon, without which, no created power could have any effect in the Conſecration; beſides, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, is a ſymbole or ſign of Authority; and therefore in this Oblation, the Prieſt layes his hands over the things offered: and as according to the Churches order, he layes his hand on thoſe who are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized or abſolved. So here he layes both hands on the Hoſt and Chalice, as being a work of a higher nature, and as a profeſſion, that this great work is to be done by vertue of his Ordination, which he received by impoſition of hands.</p>
                  <p>We have a figure of this in the old Law, for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons did lay their hands on the offered Calves, as alſo in other Sacrifices, whereof the Interpreters give three reaſons. Firſt,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:33751:149"/>That by this rite, the Offerer might teſtifie that he transfers the victime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of his hands and power into God's poſſeſſion. Secondly, To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he offers wholly the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime in <hi>holocauſt</hi> to God. Thirdly, To ſhew, that he deſires to obtain the effects of his Sacrifice, as pardon of ſins or ſuch like. <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſayes, that it was a ſymbole of the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and teſtimony of the guilt trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred into the Hoſt. <hi>Oleaſter,</hi> that by this Ceremony he did proteſt, that for his ſins he was worthy to be ſlain; but by God's mercy and will, it was changed into the killing of the offered Beaſt. Theſe Sacrifices were but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the Sacrifice, which Chriſt hath given us for our ſins, which is repreſented in the <hi>Maſſe:</hi> wherefore the Prieſt very fitly layes his hands on what is offered, as well to make this Oblation according to his prayer, as thereby to offer himſelf, and all thoſe who are joyned with him, and in a manner, impoſing his and their ſins on him, who willingly did undertake them, that by his death, he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:33751:150"/>them, and deliver us from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death: So that by the expanſion of his hands, the Prieſt puts us in mind that he is now to offer the true Sacrifice of expiation.</p>
                  <p>In the new Law we find that Chriſt did impoſe his hands on the Children and bleſs them, as on the ſick curing them. And left the ſame power to his Diſciples: who alſo in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Confirmation, and Baptiſm, did the ſame. The Church in all theſe hath the ſame Ceremonies, and here particularly in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for the impetration of God's bleſſing by the Holy Ghoſt. It may be ſaid alſo, that as the Church by impoſition of hands, does ſignifie the coming of the Holy Ghoſt; ſo here ſhe repreſents to us the deſcent or coming of our Saviour in the holy Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>Finally, This extenſion of his hands, may myſtically ſignifie the taking of our Saviour by violent hands; and the violence which the <hi>Jews</hi> and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers exerciſed on him, in the whole courſe of his paſſion: But holding the opinion of St. <hi>Anſelm</hi> and divers
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:33751:150"/>others, who affirm that our Saviour was extended on the Croſs lying on the ground; it may give us matter of Contemplation, Devotion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of Chriſt's ſufferance in each part of his Body, by the violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of his Arms and Thighs, ſtretched, rack'd and drawn out with cords, and other engines of cruelty, by Barbarous and hard-hearted Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt make five Croſſes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To ſhew that his whole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is in the merits and vertue of Chriſt's paſſion, preſented unto him in the ſign of the Croſs, which he makes here Five times. The Three firſt, do repreſent God the Father, to whom this Oblation is offered; the Son who offers it, and the Holy Ghoſt, who tranſubſtantiates or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Bread and Wine: the two following Croſſes do ſignifie the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt under one ſubſiſtence, who is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the myſtery of the Croſs in this Sacrifice.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:33751:151"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Durand</hi> has many ſuch applications ſaying, Three of them are made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was ſold to Three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to wit, Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſes; to repreſent the Three buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Prieſt makes Three Croſſes upon the Hoſt and Chalice; and the other Two ſeparately, one on the Hoſt, and another on the Chalice, to repreſent <hi>Judas</hi> who ſold him, and Chriſt who was ſold. Again, they may ſignifie the Five principall places of Chriſt's paſſion, to wit, in the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Caiphas;</hi> in <hi>Pilate</hi>'s pallace, in <hi>Herod</hi>'s Court, and on Moun-<hi>Calvary.</hi> They may alſo repreſent Chriſt's Threefold Condemnation. Firſt, By the High Prieſt and others aſſembled in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who pronounced him guilty of Death. Secondly, by the people, who cryed out Crucifie him. Thirdly, By <hi>Pilate,</hi> in his final ſentence. The Fourth may repreſent God the Son, who offered himſelf to death for our ſakes. And the Fifth, God the Father, who had decreed it from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:33751:151"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may contemplate in the five Croſſes, how Chriſt in his paſſion was mocked and derided by all, principally in five times. Firſt, In the beginning he was taken as a Thief, by moſt vile perſons, cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and withall bound, puſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, haled, drawn, mocked, ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and blaſphemed; as the cuſtome is of the Rabble on ſuch occaſions. Secondly, Before <hi>Caiphas,</hi> they ſpit on his face, and buffeted him, and others ſmote his face. Thirdly, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s Army ſet him at naught, and mocked him, putting on him a white Garment, eſteeming him a Fool. Fourthly, <hi>Pilate</hi> to ſatisfie the <hi>Jews</hi> fury, cauſed him to be ſcourged, and whipt, and the Souldiers platted a Crown of Thorns, put it upon his head; and put on him a Purple Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in deriſion, ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the</hi> Jews, and giving him blows. Laſtly, The Souldiers after <hi>Pilate</hi>'s ſentence, ſtripped him, and put a Scarlet Coat on him, and platting the Thorny Crown (the forementioned, or another) they put it on his head,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:33751:152"/>and a Reed in his right hand, bowing their knees before him in mockage, ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the</hi> Jews; and ſpitting upon his face, they took the Reed and ſmote his head.</p>
                  <p>Knowing what the Prieſt does in laying his hands on the Chalice, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that he is making or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Oblation; we may pray with him, that this Oblation may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, according to his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſeeing him make theſe Croſſes mentioned, we may contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate either in general, the great pains and dolours, which Chriſt ſuffered in the night of his paſſion, or in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar theſe paſſages thereof ſignified by theſe Croſſes.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Conſecration?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By <hi>Conſecration,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the action, or Converſion of the Bread and Wine, into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, made by the power of God; whereby the Prieſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, this act, in the perſon of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:33751:152"/>Chriſt, whoſe actions, and ſigns, or Ceremonies in his laſt Supper: are repreſented, with the ſame words, as the true form of this Sacrament; the Prieſt applyes according as our Saviour himſelf did leave it in his Church: ſuch has been the belief and cuſtome of the Church in all times ſince Chriſt. St. <hi>Juſtine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> affirms, that the <hi>Euchariſt is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the power of the word, which we have received from Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi> ſayes, <hi>This Bread as the Apoſtle ſaith, is ſanctified by the word of God and prayer, by which word the Tranſmutation is made, to wit, This is my Body:</hi> and a little before, he ſayes, <hi>I rightly believe, that now alſo the Bread ſanctified by Gods word, is changed into Chriſt's Body.</hi> And in another place, <hi>The Bread in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is common Bread; but when the myſtery is Sacrificed, it is called, and is the Body of Chriſt, in the ſame manner the Wine.</hi> St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſeconds him, in the ſame ſtrain; <hi>The Bread and Wine</hi> ſayes he, <hi>of the Euchariſt, before the Sacred invocation
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:33751:153"/>of the adorable Trinity was Bread and Wine, but the Invocation being done, the Bread is made Chriſt's body, and the Wine Chriſt's blood. Proſper</hi> ſayes, we faithful confeſs, that <hi>before the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, there is Bread and Wine, which nature framed; but after the</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, there is Fleſh and Blood, which the Benediction has Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I will conclude with that of St. <hi>Ambroſe, This Bread, is Bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacramental words; but when the Conſecration is added, from Bread it is made Chriſts Fleſh: let us prove this: how can that which is Bread he Chriſts Fleſh? by Conſecration: with what words then is the Conſecration made, or with whoſe words? with thoſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: for all the reſt that is ſaid, gives praiſes to God; prayer is made for the people, for the King, &amp; for others; when the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sacrament is to be Conſecrated, the Prieſt then uſes not his own, but Chriſts words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Did Chriſt lift up his eyes, as I ſee the Prieſt does?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Although the Evangeliſts, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:33751:153"/>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> do omit this circumſtance; yet we may believe, that as Chriſt in all great works, did lift up his eyes to Heaven (as the Evangeliſts do very often declare) ſo he did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it in this greateſt of his works. St. <hi>Clement</hi> relates it, as it is found in the Liturgies of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Did Chriſt make the ſign of the Croſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, but the Prieſt being only Chriſt's Vicegerent, or Deputy, has great reaſon to caſt up his eyes to Heaven, from whence only he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects power and vertue to do this action: or with his eyes to raiſe his heart in contemplation of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who is coming to him in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or as expecting that the Holy Ghoſt would aſſiſt him in ſo great a work, and conformably to this he makes the ſign of the Croſs, by vertue whereof, he receives the exerciſe of his power, to bleſs the Hoſt; ſhewing by it the badge of his Commiſſion, and acknowledging that as his Ordination was made with the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:33751:154"/>ſign of the Croſs, ſo here he executes it by the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt kneel down after Conſecration?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt, as ſoon as he has finiſhed the words of Conſecration, preſently kneels down, and adores the bleſſed Sacrament, as well to perform his own duty, as to give example to all preſent; of adoring in ſpirit and truth, not what they ſee with the eyes of the Body; but what with the eyes of the underſtanding they truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Body of Chriſt Jeſus, as having with it the Deity it ſelf Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he deſerves not the name of a Chriſtian, much leſs the benefit of this Sacrifice, who will not adore and worſhip it: For if the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when <hi>Moiſes</hi> only related the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Rites of the Paſchal Lamb, <hi>bowing themſelves, adored;</hi> with how great reaſon ought Chriſtians to adore the true Lamb of Chriſt Jeſus now preſented unto us? If when <hi>Moiſes</hi> entered the Tabernacle in a cloudy Pillar, wherein the Angel did ſpeak unto him, the people adored;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:33751:154"/>with much more reaſon are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to adore Chriſt Jeſus here on the Altar; if when fire came down from Heaven and devoured the <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> and glory repleniſhed the Temple, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeeing it, <hi>fell flat on the Earth, and adored and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God;</hi> ſhall not Chriſtians fall flat on the Earth, and adore the Divine fire of love, making this Sacrifice; whereof all former Holocauſts, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims and Sacrifices, were but figures and ſhadows, and wherein the King of glory, true ſubſtantial glory, the eternal word of the Father appears by faith to the eyes of our Souls?</p>
                  <p>The Three Kings are commended in the holy Writ, for their adoring Chriſt Jeſus in his Infancy, then cloathed with humane nature, the blind man being cured, ſaid, I believe Lord, <hi>and falling down adored Chriſt;</hi> the Diſciples and holy Women did the ſame, whereas they could not ſee his Divinity, but his humanity, in which they believed alſo well; what wonder then, if we adore, what we believe to be contained in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt?
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:33751:155"/>for we adore not what we ſee with our corporal eyes, but what we believe, that is, Chriſt, God and Man preſent in the holy Sacrament; and as ſuch we adore him.</p>
                  <p>With Devotion then we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Chriſt Jeſus in his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtituting this Sacrifice, which he did with the greateſt love imaginable, giving to us the greateſt gift he could, and imparting unto us his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable goodneſs, for the good of our Souls and preſervation: and in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Prieſt, or in Union with him in heart and true affection, of fear and Reverence, we adore our Lord God, who has vouchſafed to come unto us in this wonderful manner.</p>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:33751:155"/>according to their faith, make acts of adoration; both from the interiour Man, and alſo by the exteriour: that is, by humbly bowing down the Body, and lifting up the hands, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Now this Elevation has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes uſed in the Church, after the example of the Law, where the Prieſts did elevate their victims, to ſhew their voluntary oblation thereof to God, and to manifeſt that the things offered did no more pertain to the Earth, but were in God's poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Or as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayes, <hi>to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that they were to offer to God, a high, egregious, principal, and chief thing, which therefore was to be elevated, and offered to God in Solemn Rite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the Catholick Church this elevation is made for three motives, Firſt, As it is a circumſtance agreeable to the Oblation of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In as much as it concerns our proper intereſt in this Sacrifice.

For as St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> ſayes in one of his Sermons, <hi>When the moſt Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is elevated in the</hi> Maſſe, <hi>every one is bound to three things.</hi> 1. To withdraw his eyes from vain, yea from all other things. 2. To turn his eyes to the conſecrated Hoſt. 3. To adhere totally with his whole mind, with his whole endeavour by Devotion to Chriſt in this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; we may alſo ſay, that it was ſo ordained, that all perſons, who in great Aſſemblies could not ſee the Prieſt's actions; or perhaps were otherwiſe diſtracted, or detained in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:33751:157"/>their private prayers, might know that they are to adore and behold our Saviour thus elevated.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Why are Tapers or Candles then lighted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe Tapers do fitly repreſent the interiour Devotion, or rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of thoſe who are preſent: for our Holy Mother the Church by them admoniſheth us to prepare and diſpoſe our ſelves with ſuch vertues, as are neceſſary to the worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our Saviour; now come to us in the holy Euchariſt, repreſenting unto us, Faith by the light, Charity by the fire or heat, Hope by the flame, which aſcends on high; and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that we are Children of the true light of Chriſt Jeſus. The light alſo is an Emblem of Innocency and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore intimates, that we ought to come to this Sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in innocency of life, and purity of mind, that ſo in ſpirit and truth we may adore and honour our God, whereof theſe Tapers are external ſigns.</p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:33751:158"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why do many knock their Breaſts at the Elevation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, In conformity to the act of Admiration; ſo when we hear any ſtrange thing, men knock their Breaſts: now here, as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>God has made a memory of his wonderful works,</hi> our Lord indeed is marvellous in all his works, but in none ſo much as in this; wherefore with great Reaſon we admire his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs and love, whilſt he has ſo humbled himſelf, not only to become Man, but alſo Man's food, to make him God, and ſo to exalt him above the Angels. 2. It is a natural ſign of ſorrow, and grief, as daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience manifeſts. Since then in the elevation there is preſented unto us the moſt dolorous object, to wit, Chriſt ſuffering on the Croſs; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that Devout Chriſtians who have a feeling compaſſion of his dolours, ſhould knock their breaſts, as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting their interiour ſorrow. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, many do it upon Reflection, that they by their ſins, have been the cauſe of Chriſt's ſufferance, or on their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:33751:158"/>worthineſs of ſo great a good; or as our St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> ſayes, <hi>we knock our breaſts at the elevation of Chriſt's body, in which true and entire pennance is declared;</hi> and in this we imitate the Devout multitude who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at Chriſt's paſſion; and when they ſaw the things that were done, <hi>they returned knocking their breaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus</hi> will teach us to make Three actions in this time of the Elevation. 1. By faith, to behold honour, and admire the Body and Blood of our Lord; for we at that time make acts of Faith, ſaying in heart, <hi>I believe thou art true God and Man;</hi> ſince thou haſt ſo declared by thy word, and therefore ſay with the Centurion, <hi>Indeed thou art the Son of God.</hi> 2. We ought to exhibit all Honour, and Adoration to him, who hath ſo humbled himſelf in ſo mean a form to come to us. 3. We may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the great goodneſs of God in this Sacrament. Surely if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did marvel and glorifie God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that they never had ſeen the like;</hi> we may marvel and glorifie God, for
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:33751:159"/>the like favour never was ſeen, and greater there cannot be.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſuch ought our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be at this time, as if we were preſent at Chriſt's paſſion, ſeeing him hanging on the Croſs, ſweetly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding us from the Throne of his Croſs, and crying out; <hi>O all ye that paſs by the way as wayfarers, all you that are preſent at this Sacrifice, behold and ſee what</hi> I ſuffered for your Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Behold and conſider the love that I bear to you, and ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hail O true body, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>truly ſuffered, and really offered on the Croſs for me, and from whoſe ſide flowed Water and Blood, vouchſafe to be received by me at the hour of my death: O moſt merciful Jeſu Son of the living God, have mercy on me.</hi>

Theophilact,</hi> with divers others ſayes, <hi>That which is in the Chalice, is that which did flow from Chriſt's ſide; and receiving it, we communicate, that is, we are united to Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſame that I ſaid before of the Conſecration of the Bread, for the Prieſt in the Perſon of Chriſt, imitating his actions and words, does conſecrate the Chalice, calling it as Chriſt did, the New Teſtament unto Remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What ſay you of its Adoration?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſame alſo that I ſaid of the Adoration of the holy Hoſt, for it is done in the ſame manner, and for the ſelf-ſame reaſons, as being the ſelf-ſame thing under the variety of ſpecies, or material forms: the like,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:33751:160"/>we may ſay of this Elevation, and therefore not neceſſary to be rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here again.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Sith it is the ſame in both, why is the Conſecration and Elevation made apart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Although the example of our Saviour, with his command thereto and the Churches practiſe in all ages, as it plainly appears in all Liturgies, and by the Teſtimony of Councels and Fathers, are ſufficient to anſwer you; yet to ſatisfie your curioſity, I will endeavour to give you ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> having proved the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law, and Prieſthood, tells us that Chriſt has obtained a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miniſtery, and a better Teſtament, or better promiſes; and again affirms, that the firſt Law was not dedicated without blood, and that all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law were cleanſed with blood, and without ſhedding of blood, there is no Remiſſion of ſins. Chriſt then being to eſtabliſh the New Law, did Dedicate and Conſecrate it with his blood, and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:33751:160"/>as Sacraments and Sacrifices, have their effects from Chriſt's blood: wherefore he calls it the blood of the New Teſtament, as <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſays in oppoſition to the Old Law: for the Old Teſtament had blood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both people and book of the Law were ſprinkled: and again, as the Old Teſtament had immolation of blood, ſo the New Teſtament. Whereof St. <hi>Leo</hi> gives this reaſon, <hi>That ſhadows might yeild to the body, and figures ſhould ceaſe in the preſence of verity; the antient obſervance is taken away, by the New Sacrament, Hoſt paſſes into Hoſts, and Blood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Blood: Chriſt therefore to make his Law complete, did inſtitute this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in both ſpecies. It was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his great love and infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to give his body, but he would alſo give his blood, as a more perfect accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and confirmation of his Law, and in a more perfect preſentation of his Paſſion.</hi> For in the Euchariſtical action, the body is Conſecrated apart, and the blood apart, in memory of the paſſion wherein the blood was ſeparated from the body.</p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:33751:161"/>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>as often as ye ſhall eat this Bread, and drink the Chalice, ye ſhall ſhew the death of our Lord:</hi> this could not be ſo well repreſented in one ſpecies, as in both, ſo that they both together do more fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt's Death and Paſſion. Whence St. <hi>Alexander</hi> Pope and Martyr in the year 106. ſays, <hi>In the Oblation of the Sacraments which are offered to our Lord, in the Solemn</hi> Maſſes, <hi>the paſſion of our Lord is to be mixed, that the paſſion of him whoſe body and blood is repreſented, may be celebrated, and this for a particular repreſentation of the blood and water which flowed from our Saviour's ſide on the Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, both ſpecies are required, to correſpond with the nature of Chriſt's Prieſthood, which as the Pſalmiſt and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck:</hi> and St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, that he inſtituted a Sacrifice of his body and blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</hi> And St. <hi>Cyprian, who is more a Prieſt of the high God, than our Lord
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:33751:161"/>Jeſus Chriſt, who offered Sacrifice to God the Father, and offered the very ſame which</hi> Melchiſedech <hi>had offered, that is, Bread and Wine, to wit, his body and blood.</hi> With them agrees <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> ſaying, <hi>As he</hi> (that is Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech) <hi>who was a Prieſt of the Gentiles, was never ſeen to have offered any thing, but only Wine and Bread, when he bleſſed</hi> Abraham; <hi>ſo truly, firſt our Lord and Saviour himſelf, then thoſe who came from him, the Prieſts in all Nations, fulfilling the ſpiritual Office of Prieſthood, according to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordination in Bread and Wine, do repreſent the Myſteries of his body and Salutary blood.</hi> Epiphanius <hi>tells us, that the Prieſthood of</hi> Melchiſedech, <hi>which was before</hi> Levi <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>was reaſſumed, and now is in the Church from Chriſt's time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>As there are two ſpecies, are there two Sacrifices?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe two ſpecies, in regard of their ſignification, or rather in their manner of their proper ſignification, may be ſaid to be two Sacraments: but in regard of the thing ſignified,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:33751:162"/>or contained therein, they make but one Sacrifice; for as the Bread and Wine are different things, ſo in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner, they ſignifie Chriſt's body as our food, and Chriſt's blood as our drink, and ſo make the full reflection of our Souls, both making but one perfect Sacrament, in as much as they contain the ſame, one Chriſt, God and Man in fleſh and blood; which in ſubſtance are equally contained, aſwell under the ſpecies of Bread, as under the ſpecies of Wine; for the ſubſtance, body and blood, is equally in the one and in the other, producing the ſame effect of Grace and Glory.</p>
                  <p>In like manner theſe two ſpecies, with their double ſignification, do make but one Sacrifice, in as much as they ſignifie one bloody Sacrifice made by Chriſt on the Croſs in the effuſion of his blood, and ſeparation of his Soul from his Body, which is not ſo expreſly ſignified, by one only ſpecies; and the two Conſecrations do not multiply the Sacrifice, no more then the daily Oblations which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:33751:162"/>Prieſts do make in all places of the World. For as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays, <hi>Do not we offer every day? ſurely we do: But this Sacrifice is an extract of that, for we offer always the ſelf-ſame, and not now one Lamb, and to-morrow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but always the ſelf-ſame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is one Sacrifice, it is one Chriſt in every place, here entire, and there entire one body: but this which we do, is done for a Commemoration of that which was done, for we offer not another Sacrifice as the High Prieſts of the old Law, but always the ſelf-ſame.</hi> See the Annotations on the 10 of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> where many holy Fathers are cited to this purpoſe, to whom I will add the words of <hi>Primaſius</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins</hi> Scholler, <hi>The Divinity of the word of God which is every where, makes that there are not many Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but one; although it be offered by many, and that it is one body, which he took out of the Virgins Womb, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodies; even ſo one Sacrifice, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as thoſe of the Jews were:</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> on the words, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt forever: he could not ſay for
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:33751:163"/>ever, of that Oblation and Hoſt which was once made to God</hi> (to wit on the Croſs) <hi>but with reſpect to the preſent Sacrifice, by whoſe means Chriſt does Sacrifice, and is Sacrificed; who alſo in the Myſtical Supper delivered unto them the manner of this Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, although the ſpecies be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the actions of the Prieſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Conſecration various; yet ſtill it remains, that it is the ſame thing which is offered, and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame offerer Chriſt Jeſus; who did offer it to his Father, and by his Prieſts, as his Miniſters continually offers it, and ſo will to the end of the World. So that as the <hi>Maſs</hi> is an Application of one, and the ſame paſſion, ſo the Prieſts by the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial actions do only concur to the ſame Sacrifice, which Chriſt made at his laſt Supper.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, for it repreſents our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour continuing on the Croſs, but principally the blood and water which by peircing of his ſide, did flow out
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:33751:163"/>of his holy Body. St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> meditating ſayes, It is not ſaid he ſtrook, or wounded, but he opened, that thereby in a manner, the Gate of life might be opened; from whence the Sacraments of the Church do flow, without which none can enter into true life; moreover, as it is ſaid before, it may fitly repreſent the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Chriſt's Soul from his Body.</p>
                  <p>In ſpirit we may contemplate with St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that therefore Chriſt was <hi>wounded, that by his viſible wound, we might ſee the inviſible wound of his love,</hi> which St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> piouſly declares, ſaying; <hi>It did not ſuffice our Amorous Jeſus, for the manifeſting of his inebriated love; that he had once really ſhed his blood for us, on the Croſs, unleſs he ſhould daily ſhed it for us, in the Sacrament; it behoves us therefore, to raiſe ſome acts of love in correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to his love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may alſo contemplate with St. <hi>Chryſoſtome, that which is in the Chalice, is that which flowed from our Saviours ſide, wher of we are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:33751:164"/>and again, <hi>As often as we draw neer to the wonderful Chalice, we may come as ſucking from our Saviours ſide,</hi> and ſay <hi>Hail O moſt pretious blood, flowing from the ſide of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; waſh away the foul and filthy ſtains of all my life, paſt and preſent, Offences; cleanſe, ſanctifie and prepare my Soul to thy eternal bliſs,</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> The Church in this Prayer imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates our Saviour, for as he did offer up this Sacrifice on the Croſs to his Father for the Salvation of mankind, ſo here the Prieſt immediatly makes an Oblation thereof, expreſſing his intentions which he has in the Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Holy Sacrifice; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, or by degrees aſcending from the Oblation which formerly he made of Bread and Wine; now he makes it of the true body and blood of our Saviour.</p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:33751:164"/>
                  <p>Where we may note, that the Prieſt in this his prayer, joyns with the people who are preſent with him, that they may alſo offer with him, and make ſupplication, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice may have the deſired effect, and praying for all thoſe who are partakers of the holy Altar.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt make five Croſſes here on the Hoſt and Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church, as formerly hath been ſaid; ordains the ſign of the Croſs to be often uſed in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> eſpecially in the Canon, both before and after the Conſecration, but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. The Croſſes before, are in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Conſecration, as effective by way of Benediction to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wit, Bread and Wine; but after, as only repreſentative, or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative to renew in our minds Chriſts paſſion. The Croſſes before, as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative, do well ſignifie the ſeveral paſſages of Chriſt's paſſion, before he was put on the Croſs; and thoſe which follow, ſignifie what he ſuffered on the Croſs, and are conſequently applyed thereto in what follows:</p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:33751:165"/>
                  <p>Now in this place, the Prieſt firſt makes five Croſſes, to repreſent the five wounds of Chriſt hanging on the Croſs; two in his two hands, two in his two feet, and one in his ſide; they may alſo repreſent the five ſenſes of Chriſt, which at that time, had great ſufferance; for as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> notes, He ſuffered in all his corporal ſenſes; in his touch he was crucified with Nails, in his taſt he was made to drink Gall and Vineger, in his ſmell he was hanged on a Gibbet, in a filthy place of dead Carkeſſes, in his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was provoked by the voice of thoſe who blaſphemed and derided him, in his ſight he ſuffered in ſeeing his Mother and beloved Diſciples weeping.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore are there three only on both Hoſt and Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The three firſt are made on both, becauſe the terms belong equally to both; but in the fourth ſpecification is made of the Bread, and in the fifth of the Chalice; and ſo the two laſt Croſſes are made ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly; generally ſpeaking it is, ſo that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:33751:165"/>the Croſſes are made on both, unleſs the words mention them apart. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the conceit to be rejected, that will have the two laſt here made aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to inſinuate the conſequence of thoſe Chriſt's bitter pains, which made the ſeparation of his Soul from his Body.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Prieſt lay his joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hands on the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Then proceeding in his prayer or ſupplication, he bows himſelf to ſhew the humility of his heart, and with joyned hands to commit this action to the Divine providence, or thereby to repreſent the united votes and deſires of the faithful preſent in the ſame will, faith and hope; and then inclining, as expecting Gods mercy and goodneſs, prayes that God would be propitious to him in this his Oblation; and in confidence thereof he kiſſes the Altar, in ſign of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to God by vertue of this Oblation.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why then does he make three Croſſes more?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He intimates thereby, that as
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:33751:166"/>Chriſt had offered on the Croſs, ſo from the Croſs, he did offer his Blood for our Redemption. The firſt Croſs is on the Hoſt, the ſecond on the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, third on himſelf; here ſignifying unto us, that by the Oblation of his Body, and effuſion of his Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, we muſt come to receive the effects of celeſtial Benediction.</p>
                  <p>We may here contemplate our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour on the Croſs, or the Oblation which Chriſt made of himſelf, in the Sacrifice of the Croſs; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, the blood of Chriſt, who by the Holy Ghoſt offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unſpotted unto God, cleanſes our Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God, we are Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by the Oblation of the body of Jeſus, once; he offering one Hoſt for our ſins, and by one Oblation he hath conſummated for ever, them that are Sanctified; for on the Croſs he gave a conſummate Oblation, an abſolute and compleat price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sanctification; which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is here repreſented unto us, and therefore with a lively faith and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:33751:166"/>confidence we unite our ſelves in heart and affection, to this Oblation which the Prieſt here makes.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo call to mind what the Apoſtle propounds as a Law, ſaying, <hi>As often as you ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Chalice, you ſhall ſhew the death of our Lord.</hi> The Prieſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto us by the Croſſes, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold afflictions and torments of our Saviour, and herein particular, his dolours and pains in his five ſenſes, and five wounds, which we ought to have always in our memory; for as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes, <hi>The daily lecture of a Chriſtian, ought to be the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our Lord's paſſion.</hi> Chriſt always retains in his body, the ſcars and wounds of his paſſion, whereof we ſhall have a perpetual joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Chriſtians then ought to keep them in their heart, by a continual remembrance of them here on Earth; Chriſt keeps his wounds in Heaven, the Church repreſents them in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> let us keep them in our hearts.</p>

But we may add, that the Church only prayes for ſuch, who in this life had the ſign of Faith, that is, who were Baptized, and have made profeſſion thereof to their death; or at leaſt dyed in the true faith, &amp; being truly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their ſins, and dying in the ſtate of grace: which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thus expreſſes, <hi>When Sacrifices either of the Altar, or of whatſoever Alms are offered for the dead who have been Baptized, for thoſe who are very good, they are but thanksgivings, for thoſe who are not very evil, they are propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for thoſe who are very evil, they are no helps when they are dead, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the living do for them: but to whom they are profitable, they profit to

                  <p>Q. <hi>But why does the Church pray for the dead in this place?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It might ſuffice, to ſay that ſuch is the cuſtome of the Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all her Liturgies: and to queſtion this, according to St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s verdict, <hi>is inſolent madneſs;</hi> but to ſatisfie your curioſity, I will give a rational motive; if firſt you call to mind the Article of our Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Communion of Saints, which extends it ſelf not only to the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:33751:168"/>faithful on Earth, but alſo to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in Heaven, and in ſome manner to the Souls in purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who partake of this Communion, by reaſon of their Faith, Devotion, and piety in this life; for accordingly they are more or leſs capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Suffrages, and prayers of the living; and of this Oblation: whence the Church having repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Communion of them, for men who in their ſeveral degrees, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the Oblation of this Sacrifice makes remembrance of thoſe, who cannot actively concur thereto, but by the mercy of God, are capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive proportionably to their State the effects of this Sacrifice: and therefore after that the Oblation is compleated, ſhe makes it for the Dead.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo give another reaſon, for that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is a repreſentation of Chriſt's paſſion, as in each part has been obſerved, ſo in this the Church repreſents Chriſts deſcention, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now dead, according to another Article of our Creed, he deſcended
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:33751:168"/>into Hell; that is, into <hi>Limbo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> yea <hi>Purgatory it ſelf, as many Divines hold,</hi> to deliver the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and others from the Priſons wherein they were detained: For as St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chriſt deſcended to them, to draw them out and ſave them.</hi> In memory whereof the Church prayes here for the delivery or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement of the Souls in Purgatory, by making application of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to them, which is all one, and to apply unto them the paſſion and death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Although we may in charity or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation offer up the whole <hi>Maſſe</hi> for the comfort of the dead, or for ſome particular friends: yet here is the proper place to do it, in union with the prayer of the Church, which is more profitable to the Souls in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and conformable to the Churches inſtitution. Here then we may pray for our dead Parents, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Friends and Benefactors, even as we did in the <hi>Memento:</hi> for ſuch living, imagining with our ſelves, that ſuch do cry out with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church having prayed for the living, and dead, now goes to pray for ſinners; wherefore the Prieſt now returns to pray for himſelf, and for all who communicate with him in this Sacrifice, under the notion of ſinners, who in ſome manner are leſs capable of the benefit of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for the dead for whom the Church prayes are in ſtate of grace, and conſequently more apt to receive the effects thereof; whereas ſinners, as ſuch, are in an oppoſite diſpoſition.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:33751:169"/>ſhould eſteem themſelves other wiſe, they ſhould not be worthy of this Holy Sacrament: for as St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>If we ſhall ſay that we have no ſin, we ſeduce our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> The Prieſt then in his own perſon ſo acknowledges himſelf, and preſumes the ſame humility to be in all, who are there preſent, and as ſuch implores the mercy of God, putting their whole hope and truſt in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his mercies: whence <hi>Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inus</hi> and others ſay, <hi>Although we ought at all times to acknowledg before God, by confeſſion and contrition, that we are ſinners; yet eſpecially in the time of</hi> Maſſe, <hi>by which Sacrifice and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the grace of indulgence and remiſſion of ſins are mercifully granted;</hi> imitating herein the holy <hi>Thief,</hi> who being preſent at our Saviours paſſion, cryed out, We indeed are juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for we receive things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our doings: O Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That all preſent may attend to that which ſo much concerns them; for as Biſhop <hi>Steven</hi> and others teach, <hi>The raiſing of the voice, is an oral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, breaking his former ſilence, as a Teſtimony of Repentance</hi> by the voice of the Prieſt, from all thoſe who are partakers of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe;</hi> the Prieſt therefore inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts his ſecret prayer, expreſſing in words what is in his heart, thereby alſo to move the hearers, to conſider that we are all ſinners, although we are here Gods ſervants; that is, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now Gods ſervice, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are ſinners, yet with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, and firm hope, in the merits of Chriſt's paſſion we preſume to ask mercy and pardon; and as in voice he expreſſes the interiour affection of his mind, ſo by knocking his breaſt, he declares it in action, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Publican,</hi> who knocked his breaſt, ſaying, <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner:</hi> So the Prieſt here knocks his breaſt, and vertually cryes out, Lord be merciful and propitious to us ſinners.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In hope of Remiſſion of our ſins, he here prayes for the greateſt effect of this Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of, and Society with the Apoſtles and Martyrs, and all the Saints, praying that God out of his infinite mercy would pardon our ſins, and admit us into their holy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And this in correſpondence to the myſtery here repreſented for Chriſt's death is our Redemption, and the way to Heaven, is laid open unto us, whereof we have a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the good Thief who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to hear, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> which is the ſame in effect, with that which the Church here deſires; for to be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort and company of the Saints, is all one as to be in Paradiſe or Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Here we may raiſe acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and ſorrow for our ſins, and after the example of the Prieſt, knock our breaſts, ſaying in heart or word, I have ſinned Lord, and I deteſt my ſin as the unhappy cauſe of all
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:33751:171"/>thy dolours and moſt grievous ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; but thou O Jeſu the Son of <hi>David</hi> have mercy on me: and out of charity we may pray for all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and after this we may adjoyn our ſelves to the Prieſt, praying and begging that we may be aſſociated to the holy court of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt make here ſo many Croſſes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> None ought to wonder, at what the Church in all ages has pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, but piouſly conſider the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries repreſented thereby: for the Prieſt makes three Croſſes on the Hoſt and Chalice, to repreſent unto us, the three Hours wherein Chriſt hanged on the Croſs: we may alſo contemplate that Chriſt was contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reviled by three ſorts of perſons, by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> Scribes and Elders, who together with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wagging their heads, ſaid <hi>Vah,</hi> which is an interjection or voice of deriſion, inſultation, reproach, and deteſtation: thoſe who were crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him railed at him, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers alſo mocked and derided him.</p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:33751:171"/>
                  <p>Now, a little after this, the Prieſt takes the holy Hoſt, and with it over the Chalice makes the ſign of the Croſs three times, to ſignifie that the Sacrifice is available for three ſorts of perſons. 1. For thoſe in Heaven, to the increaſe of their glory; 2. For the Souls in Purgatory, to the relief of their ſufferances. 3. For thoſe on Earth to remiſſion of their ſins, and increaſe of grace. <hi>Durand</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates in theſe three croſſes, the threefold ſufferance of Chriſt on the Croſs, which he calls <hi>compaſſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi> and <hi>Paſſion. Compaſſion</hi> in heart, taking pity of our miſeries, and thirſting after our Redemption, with a moſt vehement and ardent deſire, which he expreſſed on the Croſs, when he ſaid, <hi>I Thirſt,</hi> to wit the Salvation of Souls; devout St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> ſpeaketh of this <hi>Thirſt,</hi> crys out, <hi>O love overcoming all things, how have</hi> you exceeded in good Jeſus all Torment of mind and Body? and having reſpect to the fruit of his paſſion, it only grieved him that he could not be tormented perpetually,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:33751:172"/>which the Saint thus declares, Chriſt offered himſelf for all Eternity, whence by deſire he would have dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his life, for a certain infinity &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offering it to ſuſtain infinite deaths.</p>
                  <p>Propaſſion in exceſs of charity; for as the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> ſays, <hi>He ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath born all our infirmities, and carryed all our ſorrows;</hi> he made all our ſorrows, troubles, afflictions and pains, as his own, and in them ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us; yea it more grieved him to ſee our ingratitude, and neglect of his paſſion, then all his torments; with this <hi>Propaſſion,</hi> he began his paſſion when he ſaid, <hi>My Soul is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful even to death.</hi> Chriſt, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays, <hi>did not ſo much grieve for the loſs of his temporal life, as for our ſins,</hi> and in this he continued even to his Corporal death: we may well ſay, that as death was the end of his life, ſo his ſorrow came to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that it could not be greater.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> wherein we may conſider his innumerable pains and torments, the great Abiſs of his Humility, and the infinite utility
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:33751:172"/>thereof, Cardinal <hi>Drogo</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates Chriſt hanging on the Croſs wounded in his whole Body from top to toe, and bathed all in blood, crying out, O all ye that paſs by the way, attend and ſee if their ſorrow be like to my ſorrow; if their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be like to my labour, and if their love be like to my love.</p>
                  <p>Now for the other two Croſſes, which <hi>Durand</hi> obſerves, joyning theſe to the other three, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the true ſubſtance in Chriſt his Divinity Soul and Body; and in the two laſt, the Soul and Body ſeparated in his death: but more properly theſe two laſt Croſſes which are made at the ſide of the Chalice, ſignifie the two Sacraments which did ſlow from our Saviours ſide, to wit, the water of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; the blood of our Redemption, according to the teſtimony of St. <hi>John,</hi> one of the Souldiers with a Spear opened his ſide, &amp; incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there came forth blood and water.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt lift up the Chalice and Hoſt?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To repreſent the taking down of Chriſt from the Croſs, for to this end he elevates them together, and then ſetting them down on the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, repreſents the depoſition of his body in the <hi>Syndon,</hi> to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: for <hi>Joſeph</hi> taking his body wrapped it in a clean <hi>Syndon,</hi> and laid it in his own Monument; at the which Ceremonies he concludes the Canon, ſaying.

                  <p>In beholding the Croſſes, we may meditate what Chriſt ſuffered on the Croſs, and with Devotion imitate the Prieſt, in his Adoration, in the ſame manner as at the firſt Elevation; and compaſſionatly knock our Breaſts, as opening our heart to be his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, ſaying, we acknowledge that our Sepulchers are old, and repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the filth of iniquity and ſin; but thou O Lord who haſt put thy ſelf in the hands of the malicious and wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> and faſtened thy ſelf to a moſt ignominious Croſs, dying in a moſt loathſome ſtinking place, canſt if thou pleaſeſt make it

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:33751:175"/>that nothing is found in our prayers and Oriſons, which is not comprehended in this Compendium of celeſtial Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is it ſo ſhort?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He knows beſt who made it, but we may humbly ſay, that as Chriſt did in a few words compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Law; ſo in his prayer he has included all prayers, which in words may be different, but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may be the ſame: which made St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to admire and ſay, <hi>O how ſhort is this prayer, and yet ful of vertue?</hi> if I may preſume to ſay it, Our Saviour made it ſo ſhort for the commodity of all Sexes and Ages, learned and unlearned; that each one might eaſily learn it, and retain it in memory, and uſe it with greater Devotion and Reverence.</p>
                  <p>With theſe and other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Prieſt goes forward and ſayes, with a loud voice, the <hi>Pater Noſter.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> all the people did ſay it with the Prieſt, but Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ordained, that in the Latin Church the Prieſt ſhould ſay it
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:33751:175"/>alone, and all others in ſilence may go along with him in ſaying alſo the <hi>Fater Noſter,</hi> if not in Latin, at leaſt in Engliſh: it was for this end, that amongſt others, Children were taught the <hi>Pater Noster</hi> in Latin, that they might ſay it with the Prieſt, they having formerly learned the true ſence thereof, either by their Parents, School-maſters, or Catechiſms: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all do or may anſwer, <hi>Sed libera nos a malo,</hi> but deliver us from evil.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Priest here unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Patten?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church in this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to diſcover the Reſurrection; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly we have ſaid that the Prieſt covered the Patten, with the Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, repreſenting the Apoſtles hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves; and to repreſent Chriſts Reſurrection the Patten is uncovered; intimating that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles upon the Womans warning did go to the Monument, and found the Linnen Cloaths removed and laid aſide; So the Prieſt takes away the Purificatory or Linnen Cloath off the Patten, and layes it aſide; next, the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:33751:176"/>Prieſt takes up the Patten, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in his hand, repreſents Chriſts Monument, which the Diſciples ſaw without his body. After this he prays in ſilence to repreſent the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the holy Women, during the time of Chriſts being in the Grave, until he roſe again, of which St. <hi>Luke</hi> makes mention, ſaying, <hi>they prepared Spices and Oyntments, and on the Sabbath day they reſted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Commandement:</hi> in which time they were all ſilent. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of this prayer he holds yet the Patten, ſignifying unto us the admiration of the <hi>Maries</hi> and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples beholding the empty Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then the prayer being ſaid, he ſigns himſelf with the Patten, to ſhew that all our hope is in the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and kiſſes it, to ſhew, as <hi>Durand</hi> notes, that Chriſt did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly upon his Reſurrection fulfil the Womens deſires, for he preſently <hi>met with them, ſaying, All Hail: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they took hold of his feet and Adored him:</hi> neither is it to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that they kiſſed his feet. And
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:33751:176"/>laſt of all, in ſubmiſſive manner, he puts the Patten under the Hoſt, that armed with the ſign of the Croſs, he may proceed in the performance of his Sacrifice, to which end he unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Chalice to ſhew the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection more fitly.</p>
                  <p>After we have ſaid the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> with the Prieſt, we muſt apply our minds to the myſtery of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is intended by all theſe Rites and Ceremonies, and in Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion joyn our ſelves with the bleſſed <hi>Maries,</hi> in uſing all diligence to find Chriſt Jeſus riſing in our Souls.</p>

                  <head>2. Of the Ceremonies in breaking the Holy Hoſt.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is the Hoſt here broken?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church herein follows Chriſts inſtitution, who as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts do teach, did <hi>break the Bread.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſes it with the uſual Ceremonies of Conſecration, and it was ſo notorious a circumſtance, that the whole Sacrifice did carry the name of breaking Bread: not that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:33751:177"/>the body of Chriſt is broken, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one peice from another, no more then the Soul in man is broken or divided, although the body be broken and divided, the diviſion therefore here is in the ſpecies or forms of Bread; for that the fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or breaking of the ſpecies brings not any diviſion in Chriſts body, in the venerable Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; So that although the ſpecies be divided into parts, yet Chriſt undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and unparted is known and found to be in each divided part, for it is as the Soul, whole in the whole Hoſt, and whole in every part; So the ſame body whole and entire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeparation or diviſion remains in all the Hoſts, over the whole World, and in every part and parcel of every one of the Hoſts after Conſecration. This was prefigured in the Sacrifice of fine Flower called <hi>Mincha,</hi> whereof mention is made in <hi>Lev ticus.</hi> The Bread or Cake as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> notes when it was Sacrificed to God, was to be broken or divided into little pieces.</p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:33751:177"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt divide it firſt into two parts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That is done according to the double ſtate of the predeſtinate, to wit of thoſe who are in eternal glory, and thoſe who are in this vale of miſery, which is all one to ſay, the one repreſents the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, the other the Church militant. The firſt part is laid on the Patten as being now in reſt and peace.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But why is this diviſion made over the Chalice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Beſides the moral reaſon, which is leaſt, the particles or fragmenrs which happen ſometimes in the breaking of the Hoſt might ſcatter abroad, whereas in breaking them over the Chalice, they are received therein; there is another myſtical reaſon, to give us to underſtand that the gates of Heaven were opened unto us by our Saviours paſſion, and Heaven bought by his blood</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What means the other diviſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That other part ſignifies the militant Church, which is again divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whereof the one part repreſents
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:33751:178"/>thoſe who are in purgatory, with hope and aſſurance of being joyned to the Triumphant Church, in ſign whereof the Prieſt layes it down, joyning it to the former part on the Patten. Now the third part repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the militant Church on Earth, is held over the Chalice, whilſt the Prieſt concludes his prayer according to the wonted manner, ſaying, <hi>per omnia ſaecula ſaeculorum,</hi> for ever and ever, whereto <hi>Amen</hi> is anſwered. Now the prayer was for Chriſts peace which he brought into the World by his Reſurrection; whence the Prieſt making three Croſſes on the Chalice, denounceth that peace, ſaying, <hi>Pax Domini ſit ſemper Vobiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt as now riſing, ſaith, The peace of our Lord be always with you; which is the ſame with the <hi>Pax vobis,</hi> Peace be with you; which Chriſt gave to the Diſciples, when he appeared to them after his Reſurrection. St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſays, Peace be to you, ſaid Chriſt to his Diſciples; whence there is a certain Law delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:33751:178"/>us by the Church: for in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations we ſalute one another in this manner, the words are full of Love and Authority, and the good tydings of the Reſurrection of Chriſt in our Souls by the amiable and and full offer of peace to men of good will; all impediments or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles of our Salvation are taken away, and a glorious Trophy of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over Death, Sin and Hell is ſet up with this inſcription of peace.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Why then does the Prieſt make three Croſſes over the Chalice with the third part?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To intimate that Chriſts peace is not to be had, but by the Croſs planted in our hearts, profeſſed in our mouths, and imitated in our actions; or to ſignifie that Chriſts Reſurrection was after that he had been three days in the Grave, repreſented by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. The Angel of the Schools ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates this Ceremony more myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to our Salvation, ſaying, that three Croſſes are in honour of the moſt holy Trinity, who ſent the Lamb to make peace by the Croſs to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:33751:179"/>Angels and Men. It may alſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the threefold peace which Chriſt has brought by his paſſion, to wit, internal, external and ſupernal. The firſt is the interiour peace of the mind and Conſcience, which cannot be had but by Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>In me you may have peace.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> affirms that this peace of the mind is ſo quiet and ſettled, that it is not troubled with any paſſion, for the holy Soul feeling it ſelf free from the terrours of pain and puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in grace, and friendſhip with God, enjoys wonderful peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond peace is that which makes the union of mind and will with our Neighbours, to this peace St. <hi>Paul</hi> invites us, ſaying, <hi>Have peace, and the God of peace, and love ſhall be with you;</hi> and again he earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhorts us thereunto, <hi>adviſing us to be careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;</hi> for peace is a chain or cement which unites, conjoyns and tyes together Chriſtian hearts.</p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:33751:179"/>
                  <p>The Third peace is properly the peace of God, which as the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>paſſes all underſtanding, and is the peace which the Soul has with God,</hi> the perfection whereof we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the life to come: So that we may well call Chriſt Jeſus his riſing, our peace, pacifying by the blood of the Croſs, whether the things on Earth, or the things that are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now to ſhew that this Triple peace comes to us by Chriſts blood, the Prieſt immediately lets fall the particle into the Chalice of Chriſts blood.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration of what has been ſaid, we may call to mind the words of St. Paul, <hi>If we become complanted to the ſimilitude of his death, we ſhall alſo be of his Reſurrection:</hi> by Chriſts death which we have hitherto medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, we may come more eaſily to conſider his Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may contemplate the Reſurrection, and with the holy Women, raiſe acts of fear and joy, for it is ſaid, <hi>they went forth quickly</hi> out of the Monument, with fear and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:33751:180"/>great joy. A double affection, ſayes St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> of fear and joy did poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Womens minds, one for the greatneſs of the Miracle, the other from the viſion of him that was riſen, or as <hi>Enthemius</hi> ſayes, with fear for the wonderful things they had ſeen, with joy alſo, for the joyful tydings which they heard; let us with fear conſider our unworthineſs, and with joy contemplate the Reſurrection, which aſſures us of our Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>To this end St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chriſt was delivered up for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtification.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was the term and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the paſſion, merits, and of all Chriſts oeconomie. Whence the Reſurrection and paſſion are eſteemed as one work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and one moral compleat action: whereby together and at once Chriſt merited Remiſſion of our ſins, and our juſtification; which we may believe was the occaſion, that the Church in this place adds the repreſentation of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:33751:180"/>the rather becauſe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>if Chriſt be not riſen again, vain is our faith,</hi> for Chriſts death would not have been efficacious if he had remained in Death; Death would have been victorious; Let us therefore joyn with the Church in joy and exultation for ſo happy Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may conſider how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the Church in this place prays for peace, both in the precedent, as alſo in the following prayers; let us joyn ours, humbly begging the peace of mind, which is a perfect diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the receiving of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and ſpiritual grace; for as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes, <hi>where peace is, there all things will proſper,</hi> and ſurely without fraternal peace, according to our Saviours Decree, we are not in a fitting diſpoſition to offer Sacrifice, and the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> devoutly taken, will bring us to the peace of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> when he ſaw Chriſt coming to him, ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, behold him that takes away the ſins of the World:</hi> from whom the Church has taken theſe words.

                  <p>Firſt, he is ſo called becauſe as a Lamb, he was offered on the Croſs for the Redemption of the World: ſo the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt ſayes, <hi>I am a mild Lamb that is carried to ſlaughter,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſtiles him <hi>the Lamb that was ſlain.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Laſtly, and moſt properly to this place, the Sacred Text teſtifies that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by Gods command, among other Sacrifices had one which was called the daily Sacrifice, and was of two Lambs, one in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the other in the evening, which did figuratively repreſent the true Lamb Chriſt Jeſus, who is our daily Sacrifice, and as ſuch, is here invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt having ended the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> with grant us peace, now ſilently prayes for that peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as in the other two following, he
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:33751:184"/>ſtands in all ſubmiſſion with joyned hands on the Altar, inclining his body, and devoutly caſting his eyes on the holy Sacrament, reflects on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which Chriſt made of giving his peace to his Apoſtles, and in them to his Church; in confidence whereof, and diffidence of his own merit, he begs this peace by the faith of the Church, to whom this peace was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; and knowing well that the peace of each one in particular, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the peace of the Church, he adds his humble petition that Chriſt would vouchſafe to pacifie or make peace therein, and unite all the members thereof in the ſame Faith.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Church ſo much pray here for peace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe as when Chriſt came into the World, peace was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when he was to leave this World, he bequeathed his peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; So after his Reſurrection he more frequently preſented this peace unto us. Now the Church in this place, repreſents myſtically unto us, what our Saviour did after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:33751:185"/>in giving us his peace; and here principally deſires, that we may be all made worthy to receive that peace, which is ſo ſweetly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and imparted to us.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt kiſs the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Pax?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt having made his prayer for peace, delivers that peace to all preſent; and firſt kiſſing the Altar, as if he did ask leave to do it, or rather to ſhew that the peace he gives comes from Chriſt himſelf; He alſo kiſſes the Pax, ſaying, <hi>peace be with thee;</hi> which are the words which the Angel ſpeak to <hi>Gideon</hi> in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and much uſed by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The Prieſt in this, as in the perſon of Chriſt, preſents this peace unto all preſent, and they with much humility receive the ſaid Pax, and devoutly kiſs it, that with the ſame peace and charity they may be united in heart and affection.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is this Pax now adayes omitted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In all, I have hitherto follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Rites and Ceremonies ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:33751:185"/>in the Miſſal, and ſo could not well omit this. I know it has been in uſe even in the primitive times, in ſome manner or other: and in the Miſſal it is ſuppoſed with order not to have it done in <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the dead, and how it was left off I know not, but as I highly commend the obſervation of it, as carrying with it a pious my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of mutual peace in our hearts; So I will not preſume to condemn that which I ſee practiſed in many places.</p>
                  <p>Others may ſay that it cauſes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction and diſturbance, which at ſuch a time eſpecially are to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but under correction, on the ſame pretence many other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, not ſo ſignificant, may alſo be taken away; and certainly if it be ſo, much more the kiſs of peace uſed in the primitive times, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was then eſteemed a moſt pious Ceremony. There is one reaſon which carries with it ſome appearence, and that is, for that this Ceremony being as a diſpoſition to Communion, which was <hi>Quotidian,</hi> it was thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:33751:186"/>to be uſed every day, but the frequent Communion ceaſing, that alſo was omitted.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is it omitted generally at ſometimes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> According to the Rubricks, neither this prayer nor the Pax is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the Dead, for the reaſons aforeſaid, touching the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem</hi> or the <hi>Agnus Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are to Communicate, ought with all Devotion to pray for this peace, which as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayes, hath no end of time, and is the very perfection of all our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions; for by this we are furniſhed with the Sacraments; whence St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> calls the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt <hi>Sacramentum Pacis,</hi> a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace, for it brings peace, and requires a mind which loves and deſires peace. And St. <hi>Bernard, The love of loves, love tranſcending all love, for Chriſt is not contented to give us his preſence, but he will give a kiſs of the mouth, that is, enter into our mouths, yea to our hearts to make a perfect union with our Souls.</hi> Let us therefore with
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:33751:186"/>Devotion anſwer, <hi>Et cum ſpiritu tuo,</hi> and with thy ſpirit, which all ought to do when they receive the Pax; which St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thus declares, <hi>when we</hi> (that is the Prieſt) ſay, <hi>Pax tecum, peace be with you: ſay, and with thy ſpirit,</hi> do not anſwer in voice only, but in mind alſo, not ſo much pronounce in mouth as in mind: let us therefore take it as coming from the mouth of Chriſt who ſo often uſed it to his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Prieſt in the ſame poſture of humility, with hands joyned on the Altar, we may gather that he prays in order to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which he is preſently to make; if we are to communicate, we may joyn our intentions with the Prieſt for that end, or in ſpirit medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what we are to do, or by ſome jaculatory prayers to prepare our ſelves to Communion; thoſe who are not to communicate, may alſo offer their intentions with the Prieſt for the obtaining the effects of this holy Sacrifice, for which he devoutly prayes.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the words are very pious, and may be appropriated to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:33751:187"/>any one who Communicates, I ſhall ſet them down here; the Prieſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly ſayes, <hi>I will take the celeſtial Bread, and will invocate the name of our Lord,</hi> wherein we may note two things, the firſt is of taking the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bread, the ſecond of invocating the name of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Of the firſt, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayes, <hi>we call it our Bread, becauſe Chriſt, unto whoſe body we come, is our Bread, for Chriſt ſaid, I am the Bread of life, which deſcended from Heaven. It is true, the Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of the</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>ſayes, Bread of Heaven he gave them Bread of Angels did man eat; whence it may well be called celeſtial Bread, becauſe it came from Heaven;</hi> yet being but a figure and ſhadow in compariſon of this celeſtial Bread, it comes ſhort of ſuch a real and true Denomination. For this let us hear Chriſt's own Argument: <hi>Our Fathers did eat</hi> Manna <hi>in the Deſart;</hi> as it is written, Bread from Heaven he gave them to eat, lo how gloriouſly they ſpeak of this <hi>Manna;</hi> and indeed ſtanding in the Negative opinion, of

                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:33751:189"/>the reral preſence, they might glory even over that which is figured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, taking it in all reſpects even in the nature of a ſign. But Chriſt ſays, <hi>Amen Amen I ſay to you,</hi> Moſes <hi>gave you not the Bread from Heaven, but my Father gives the true Bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> and again, <hi>I am the living Bread that came down from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we may note firſt, That <hi>Moſes</hi> who gave <hi>Manna,</hi> was but a meer man, and that to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> only. But Chriſt God and Man, gives this celeſtial Bread to the whole World. Secondly, <hi>Manna</hi> is ſaid to be from Heaven, not properly, but as Heaven is taken for the Air; but this Bread is truly ſaid to be celeſtial, becauſe it comes from the higheſt Heavens, deſcending from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father. Thirdly, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was framed by the Angel at the prayer of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did frame this Euchariſtical Bread, and gave it to us: whence Chriſt ſayes, that it is <hi>true Bread from Heaven,</hi> or truly celeſtial, and that not only becauſe it comes truly
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:33751:189"/>from Heaven, but alſo becauſe it is ſo by nature and ſubſtance. Secondly, Becauſe it produces celeſtial or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly effects, as grace and life in Jeſus Chriſt. Thirdly, It brings us to the celeſtial Kingdom, by giving life Everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond, in ſaying celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bread, he incites himſelf to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reducing to his memory what he is to take, and how he is to take it, to wit, by invocating the name of our Lord, that ſo he may receive it with greater fear and reverence. O Lord, ſayes St. Ambroſe, <hi>with how great contrition and fountain of Tears, with how great reverence and fear, with how great charity and purity of mind, is this Divine and celeſtial Myſtery to be celebrated; where thy fleſh is in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity received, where thy blood is truly drunk? and therefore in heart and voice he cryes out, I will invocate the name of our Lord; for it is he alone that can make me worthy to receive this celeſtial food.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we may note, that to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the name of our Lord, admits
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:33751:190"/>many interpretations: for firſt it may ſignifie an act of Sacrifice, as when <hi>Abraham</hi> had built an Altar to our Lord, <hi>he called upon his name;</hi> and in the Chapter following, it is ſaid <hi>there, he called upon the name of our Lord,</hi> that is, Sacrificed to our Lord. Whence St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes, <hi>Where</hi> Bethel <hi>is, that is, the houſe of God, there the Altars are, where the Altars are, there is the invocation of our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is taken for Gods true Worſhip, ſo <hi>Enoch began to invocate the name of our Lord,</hi> that is, in a publick manner to Worſhip God: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>ſhall invocate the name of our Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> where under the title of invocation, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand profeſſion of the name of our Lord Jeſus, as alſo all Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>We will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to thee O God, we will confeſs, and will invocate thy name, we will praiſe and bleſs thee O God;</hi> we will confeſs to thee with heart, mouth and work, that ſo we may confidently invocate
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:33751:190"/>thy name: which St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> thus explicates, <hi>if we invocate with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and devout heart, and not with a polluted mouth: for true invocation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes true contrition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This invocation of our Lords name, or by our Lords name, is the beſt manner of prayer, which alſo our Saviour commended unto us, ſaying, <hi>Amen Amen I ſay to you, if you ſhall ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it to you:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> notes, <hi>Chriſt did ſhew the vertue and power of his name, for being only named</hi> (invocated) <hi>he doth wonderful things with the Father.</hi> The name of Chriſt invocated is a great ſecurity or aſſurance of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what we pray for.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This invocation of the name of our Lord, proceeds from a firm hope and confidence in Gods mercy and goodneſs: for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>The name of our Lord is a moſt ſtrong Tower, the juſt run into it and ſhall be exalted.</hi> The name of our Lord is a refuge to all; the only hope of ſinners is to invocate his name,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:33751:191"/>whence the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> cryes out, <hi>Thy name O Lord, and thy memorial are in the deſires of the Soul; I will alwayes invocate thy name,</hi> and the whole deſires of my Soul is, that thy name may be invocated by all, and that it may be a memorial of thy goodneſs to all: that I with them may alwayes have in memory the glory of thy name.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, in ſaying theſe words, <hi>I will invocate the name of our Lord,</hi> then conſequently to the whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> the Prieſt offers the celeſtial Bread to God the Father, by invocating his name, that this his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he is now to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, may be acceptable to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, which in all ſumbiſſive manner as he has exteriourly adored, ſo interiourly in heart and affection he adores and worſhips what he is to receive; and in a few words expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the interiour Devotion of his Soul, and the vehement deſire which he hath, that what he does therein may be to the glory of God, which he principally intends in this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:33751:191"/>and in ſpirit and deſire, his Soul lancheth forth to praiſe and glorifie the holy name of God, who has vouchſafed to give him this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bread, this food of Angels, the very Body and blood of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time whilſt we ſeeing the Prieſt going to take the Holy Hoſt, we may make our prayers, that God would accept of the Sacrifice, which the Prieſt now is to conclude; and if we are to communicate, we may beg the ſame grace which the Prieſt now receives, and here with the advice of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Seek our Lord whilſt he may be found, and invocate him whilſt he is near to us,</hi> we need not go far to ſeek him; for he is come to us, and hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuſceptible by us, in the moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way imaginable. For he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our food, our celeſtial Bread here on Earth; we can never have a better time to invocate him, than when he is ſo near, deſcending to our imbecility and frailty, more willing to be with us, than we to be with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:33751:192"/>him. O can we doubt but that if we truly invocate his name with fervent Devotion, he will give us his grace, his juſtice and his mercy, yea what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever good we deſire? for as he hath given himſelf, ſo with him all things.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo contemplate the great Devotion of the Apoſtles, when they were to receive the holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> from the hands of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and imitate them therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that inviſibly we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame from our Saviour by the Miniſtery of the Prieſts.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes us, <hi>To work our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> for divers reaſons; Firſt, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of grace, for we know not whether we be in grace; the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes ſayes, <hi>No man knows whether he be worthy of love or hatred.</hi> And Job, <hi>Although I ſhall be ſimple, the ſelf-ſame my Soul ſhall be ignorant of.</hi> St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> ſaid, <hi>Although my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience do not accuſe me, yet it does not ſecure me;</hi> nay the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> adds, <hi>if
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:33751:194"/>ſins forgiven be not without fear,</hi> for we do not ſee the depth of our heart, not knowing whether ſome ſecret vice lies hid there, or whether our good works were depraved by ſome perverſe intention.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe the judgments of God are ſecret, whence <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>If I will juſtifie my ſelf, mine own mouth will condemn me; If I will ſhew my ſelf innocent, he</hi> (God) <hi>ſhall prove me wicked.</hi> Hence St. <hi>Auguſtine, Woe even to the laudable life of Men, if God withdrawing his mercy examins it;</hi> And St. <hi>Hierome, All the World ſtands in need of Gods mercy, none can go ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely to the Judge without it;</hi> And therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſayes again, <hi>Although I have any juſt thing, I will not anſwer, but will beſeech my Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe man by his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted inclinations, is in a manner neceſſitated to ſin, which by his frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, proneneſs and inconſtancy he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid; <hi>which</hi> as St. <hi>Leo</hi> ſayes, <hi>is the cauſe that holy men do fear and tremble, leſt puffed up even with works
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:33751:195"/>of piety, they loſe the help of grace, and remain in Natures infirmity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe we have cruel and ſtrong Enemies, who cruelly and ſecretly uſe all means imaginable, to circumvent and intrap us. So we read that when the Sons of God were come to aſſiſt before our Lord, Satan was preſent among them: amongſt other his malicious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, he is then moſt buſied when men are imployed in Gods Service, even in their moſt pious actions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Becauſe our perſeverance in grace, is altogether uncertain: for although one be juſt and fervent in Devotion, yet indulging to his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, by little and little; he may wax tepid, frail, and fall: which even St. <hi>Paul</hi> did apprehend, when he ſaid, <hi>I chaſtiſe my body, and bring it into ſervitude, leſt perhaps when I have Preached to others, my ſelf become a Reprobate.</hi> Well ſaid St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> if St. <hi>Paul did fear this when he was ſuch a Preacher, and after Preaching, and taking upon him the charge of the whole World, was afraid, O what ſhall I ſay?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:33751:195"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſſian</hi> advices us to <hi>hold for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that we cannot by any means, come to ſo great merit of Purification,</hi> that if by the Grace of God, we ſhould do all things <hi>even above what we can imagine, yet we may believe our ſelves unworthy of the Communion of his Sacred Body;</hi> becauſe the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of this celeſtial <hi>Manna,</hi> is ſo great, that no man loaded with this earthly Fleſh, by his merit, and not of our Lords freely beſtowed boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may receive it. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none in the conflict of this World, can be ſo circumſpect, that at leaſt ſome light darts of ſin ſhould not ſtrike him.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing them to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and holy, yet in regard of the great Majeſty, all ought to fear and tremble; for St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did not think himſelf worthy to looſe the latchet of Chriſt's Shooes; how much more ought we to think our ſelves unworthy to receive Chriſt in this holy Sacrament? Bleſſed <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Mother of the ſame humble Saint, cryed out, <hi>Whence is this to me, that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:33751:196"/>the Mother of God my Lord doth come to me?</hi> She juſtly admires whence it ſhould come that Jeſus and his Mother ſhould come to her: with how much more reaſon ought we to cry out, Whence is this to me, poor miſerable Creature, that my Lord himſelf doth come to me in this humble manner?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Who then dares to receive?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt freely invites all to this Table; and that none may excuſe themſelves, he comes in this moſt humble manner, that he may take away all occaſion of excuſe, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, for he has made himſelf our daily Bread, deſcending as low as his Majeſty will permit, to be our food, and exalting our nature to make it capable to receive it worthily, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his moſt merciful accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which the Church declares in theſe words, <hi>ſay but the word, and my Soul ſhall be ſaved,</hi> that is, made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receive the Sacrament wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily: for in theſe words by an Act of Faith, we acknowledge the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power of God, whoſe word
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:33751:196"/>is ſo efficacious and powerful. It is certain we ſtand in need of cure for our infirmities, and with the wiſe man we may well ſay, <hi>neither Herb nor Plaiſter</hi> (that is, no natural means or humane induſtry) <hi>can heal us,</hi> but thy word, O Lord, which heals all things; ſay then this word, and I ſhall be healed. The Royal Prophet ſayes, by the <hi>word of our Lord the Heavens are eſtabliſhed, and he ſaid the word, and all things were made.</hi> Loe here a Subject which ſtands in need of this infinite power, ſay then the word, and make me worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is</hi> Domine non ſum dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>repeated three times?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> For to make a deeper impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in our Souls, as on the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has been formerly declared.</p>
                  <p>Here we may with Devotion joyn with the Prieſt, in ſaying theſe words, O Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt enter under my Roof, but ſay the word and I ſhall be ſaved, with conſiderations proportionable
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:33751:197"/>to what hath been ſaid, which every one may apply to themſelves.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In that he requires life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, all other good is ſuppoſed, for to this part of life, Remiſſion of ſins, delivery from the Devils ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt, and ſuch are neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed. So that in asking life Everlaſting, he askes all the reſt; and he who eats Chriſts Fleſh, and drinks his Blood, hath an aſſurance of life Everlaſting; for in that he receives him who is all in all, he may expect with him all grace, for he is Grace, Life, and Fortitude, Way, Medicine, Nouriture and Pledge of life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, in order to which he gives us this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is it called Communion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> St. <hi>Denis</hi> frequently calls the receiving of the holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which is as much to ſay as common Union, whereby we are united in Chriſt Jeſus; for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Being many we are
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:33751:198"/>one Bread, one Body, all that participate of one Bread:</hi> of which St. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſayes, <hi>If we all eat one body, we are made all one body.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo, <hi>We are reduced into one Maſſe with him, we are made one body, and one fleſh of Chriſt;</hi> And in another place ſpeaking of the Communicants, he ſayes, <hi>Thou art not nouriſhed by one body, and he by another, but we are all nouriſhed by the ſame body. Chriſts infinite love has made his body common unto us, as our common and daily food: it is common to rich and poor, young and old.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> explicates it thus, <hi>The faithful may be made Chriſts body, if they will live by Chriſts Spirit, he does not live by Chriſts Spirit, unleſs he be of Chriſts body: he that will live hath whereby to live, let him approach, believe, and be incorporated, that he may be quickned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why then does the Prieſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Communicate alone?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To ſatisfie you in this, I will produce the words of the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 6 <hi>The holy Synod would indeed wiſh that in each Maſſe
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:33751:198"/>the faithful aſſiſting would Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: not only by ſpiritual affection, but alſo by Sacramental reception of the Euchariſt; whereby more plentiful fruit of this moſt holy Sacrifice might come unto them; Nevertheleſs if this be not alwayes done, does it therefore condemn thoſe Maſſes, wherein the Prieſt alone Communicates Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, as private and unlawful? No, but rather approves, and the rather commends, for that the Maſſes alſo ought to be eſteemed truly common, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the people communicate ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in them, and partly for that they are celebrated by a publick Miniſter of the Church, not only for himſelf, but for all the faithful who partain to the body of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is this a new thing, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved in the Roman Church; for the Grecians have their Liturgies, without company to Communicate with the Prieſt; ſometimes it is ſo in <hi>Aſia, Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and whereſoever the Chriſtian Religion is profeſſed; indeed it has been often ordained in the Church that none
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:33751:199"/>ſhould celebrate <hi>Maſſe</hi> alone, but that he ſhould have one or two to be preſent with him, but it was never required of neceſſity that any one ſhould Communicate with him.</p>
                  <p>We may note here that the Church excludes none from the Communion, but wiſhes that all, not lawfully hindered, ſhould do it, which impediments occurring, ſhe invites and admoniſhes them to do it ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or as the Council ſayes, in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection, by applying their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions with the Prieſt, who as a publick Miniſter offers the Sacrifice for all, whereof each one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, according to his Devotion may be partaker.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What is it to Communicate ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſame Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> puts down three manners of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. 1. Sacramental only, as thoſe who are in mortal ſin. 2. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually only, to wit, thoſe who eating <hi>in voto,</hi> with a lively faith, which works by love, that celeſtial Bread ſet before them, do feel the fruit and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:33751:199"/>profit thereof. 3. Sacramentally and ſpiritually, ſuch are thoſe who firſt prove and prepare themſelves that they may approach with the Nuptial Garment to this Divine Table, and do actually receive the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>From hence we may gather, what application the Aſſiſtants at <hi>Maſſe</hi> may make of the Prieſts Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if they are to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, they are to prepare themſelves in the ſame manner as the Prieſt does; but if they do not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſacramentally, they may do it ſpiritually; whereto the holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil requires three Conditions, that they have a vow, or will, and fervent deſire, to Communicate really if they could conveniently, for ſuppoſing a lawful impediment, the will is taken for the work; and many times ſuch a vow or deſire with other concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent circumſtances, may be as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as the actual Communion.</p>
                  <p>To make this more clear, all agree that if any one hath a vow, or effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſire, with perfect contrition

                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:33751:201"/>and love of God, to be Baptized and cannot attain to it, he may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaved, which is all one as to receive the effects of real Baptiſm; even ſo in this place the Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this ſpiritual Communion to be in vow and deſire, and with it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires faith, on which the deſire is grounded, and without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; for he that comes to Chriſt muſt believe that he is really in the Sacrament, and a rewarder of them who ſeek him; God will not leave our good deſires unrewarded; nor hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from them that ſeek him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt be with a lively faith that is accompanied with grace, for it is neceſſary that he be in the ſtate of grace, and free from mortal ſin at leaſt. It muſt therefore be a lively faith that is a working faith, which imploys all the faculties and powers of the Soul. Thirdly, to be meritorious and with profit, it muſt be a faith working by Charity, which together make a true act of charity or love of God; ſuch without all
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:33751:201"/>queſtion may feel and receive the effects of the Sacrament; and may well ſay, <hi>O Lord ſay the Word, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully ſhew thy goodneſs to me, that by vertue of this thy Sacrifice, I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy grace, and reap the benefit thereof, and be worthy to hear and feel in my Soul, that moſt merciful ſentence, Be it done to thee as thou haſt believed;</hi> and you ſhall receive the effects of the Sacrament, or as the Council ſayes, you ſhall receive the fruit and profit thereof.</p>
                  <p>Our ſubtile Doctour <hi>Scotus</hi> tells us who they are who communicate ſpiritually, to wit, he who is juſt (that is, not infected with mortal ſin) and according to his power, is well and Devoutly prepared to receive the body of Chriſt, and yet abſtains out of Reverence, or for ſome infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or becauſe he can have none to Miniſter unto him. And our St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> calls it <hi>ſpiritual eating:</hi> to which two things are required, conſideration of faith and affection of love; he only eats ſpiritually who has faith and charity in Chriſt,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:33751:202"/>intending with Devotion to take this Sacrament, to wit, if he were not hindred. The ſame St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> requires three things in this ſpiritual eating. 1. Hunger. 2. Maſtication. 3. Delectation. Firſt, we ought to hunger after Chriſt ardently, and ſpiritually deſiring him; for as our B. Lady ſaid, <hi>The hungry he hath filled with good things;</hi> by hunger we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the deſires of the Soul, and ſuch reigning one eaſily believes and hopes what he deſires. The ſecond St. <hi>Bernardine</hi> thus explicates, the ſpiritual Maſtication or chewing, is properly an exact conſideration, or meditation on Chriſts body, expoſed as the price of our Redemption, and as food for our refection. The Third ariſes from the two former, for from thence the Soul is inflamed with love, which cauſes delight and ſweetneſs, for the thing believed or repreſented in the mind, frequenly cauſes a joy in the Soul, for love ſo inflames the heart of them with unſpeakable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that it makes the Soul to melt in it ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:33751:202"/>
                  <p>Having ſpoken thus much of the ſpiritual Communion, I muſt alſo ſpeak of the Sacramental and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communion.</p>

                  <p>None can deny but that it was a pious cuſtome to Communicate dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet not common to all, for it is certain that many holy perſons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Sanctity, did not take it Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally for many years, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe who did live in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts; yet St. <hi>Baſil</hi> does not ſtick to ſay, that thoſe who did lead a ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life in the Deſart, where there was no Prieſt, did keep the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in their Cells, and Communicate themſelves, nay in <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> every one of the people for the moſt part did the ſame.</p>

Another on the contrary affirms, that it is to be taken daily, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let every one do what according to his faith he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly believes is to be done: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe do diſhonour our Lords body and blood, ſith they ſtrive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending who may do beſt to honour this moſt holy Sacrament: for <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> and the <hi>Centurion</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend among themſelves, nor did any of them prefer himſelf before the other, when one of them did receive our Lord in his houſe with joy; the other ſaid, <hi>I am not worthy thou ſhouldſt enter under my Roof;</hi> both honouring our Saviour, though not in the ſame manner; both miſerable by ſin, both obtained mercy; and concludes, one
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:33751:204"/>in honouring God, does not take it daily; and another in honouring God, does not omit any day. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God in theſe our later times we have ſome, who if not every day, yet very frequently with Devotion receive the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and ſome who out of humility forbear: but I fear we have too too many, who under this cloak, give way to the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Enemy, and more who neglectfully omit it.</p>
                  <p>To ſuch I may ſay, with St. <hi>Chryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſtome,</hi> Even as it is perillous for him that is cold (to wit, in mortal ſin) to come to it, ſo no participation of that Myſtical Supper is poyſon or deſtruction; for this Table is the ſtrength of our Souls, the nerves of the mind, the bond of confidence, our foundation, hope, ſalvation, light, and life: ſurely if any one did juſtly conſider this, he would not eaſily forbear. But alas, we eaſily ſuck poyſon and peſtilential vanities of the World, which lead us the way to Hell; we gormandiſe our ſelves,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:33751:205"/>with what is pleaſant to the Palate, not rarely the readieſt way to our Grave, and ſtill with danger of going further, even to Hell; and leave the means to prevent all evil.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, we are ſinners, and ſo dare not appear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom <hi>Caſſian</hi> anſwers, we ought not therefore ſuſpend our ſelves from the Communion of our Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we acknowledge our ſelves ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but rather more greedily haſten more and more to it, both for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of our Soul, and purification of the Spirit: but yet with humility of mind and faith, that judging our ſelves unworthy to receive ſo great grace, we rather ask remedy for our wounds; otherwiſe, even the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Communion is not worthily to be preſumed: as ſome ſo meaſure the Dignity, Sanctification, and worth of the celeſtial Sacraments, that they eſteem none but Saints and unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould preſume to take them; and not rather, that by their partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, they might make us holy and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:33751:205"/>clean. Such truly incur more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of arrogance in declining it, then as it ſeems to them, of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: for when they receive them, they judge themſelves worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. It is much more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that, with that humility of heart (whereby we believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that according to our merits we can never come to thoſe ſacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries) we preſume to take them every Sunday, for remedy of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, than puffed up with a vain perſwaſion of mind, that after a year we ſhould believe our ſelves to be made worthy to partake thereof.</p>
                  <p>The counſel of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, <hi>Take that daily which daily profits thee; ſo live, that thou mayeſt deſerve to take it daily: he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to take it daily, deſerves not to take it after a year.</hi> As holy <hi>Job</hi> did daily offer for his Sons, leſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might ſome way have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Thou doeſt hear, that as often as the Sacrifice is offered, the death of our Lord; his Reſurrection and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:33751:206"/>Aſcention are declared, and Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Why then doeſt thou not take the daily Bread of life? He that hath a wound ſeeks cure for the wound, becauſe we are in ſin, the Medicine and cure is the celeſtial and venerable Sacrament: we ſay give us this day our daily Bread, if thou takeſt it daily, it is to thee daily, that is every day.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with the Golden words of St. <hi>Baſil. It is</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>an excellent thing and very profitable, to communicate every day, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the body and blood of Chriſt, he manifeſtly ſaying, He that eats my Fleſh and drinks my Blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, has life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting: for who doubts but that the frequent participation of life, is nothing elſe then to live many wayes? We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore communicate four times in a week, on Sunday, Wedneſday, Fryday and Saturday, and other dayes, if there be a memory of ſome Saint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, take away mortal ſin, which is done by the Sacrament of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; I ſee nothing but want of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:33751:206"/>oppertunity may juſtly hinder us from daily Communion: for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a fountain of grace, and of its own nature take away daily and venial ſins. If we are ſick, here is our Medicine: if wounded, here is a cure: if tempted, a refuge: if hungry, Bread of life: if thirſty, here is a fountain of life: if in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or want, here is a Heavenly Treaſure laid open to all: If ſinners, here is remiſſion and indulgence. For our Saviour has left this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a remedy for all our evils, and daily offers himſelf to us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually invites us to this celeſtial Banquet. I may ſay with St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, Chriſt calls us to Heaven, and we draw back and loyter, and make no haſte, neither do we run to the thing which is the hope of our Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some indeed may pretend imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſecular affairs, although I believe, very few would neglect their corporal food for them: but are thoſe imployments lawful and good? if not, attend and repent, if ſo, will
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:33751:207"/>Communion hinder them? no, but rather impart a Benediction to their endeavours. O but we have not time to prepare our ſelves for ſo great a Sacrament. If urgent and neceſſary, I will ſpeak no further: but generally ſpeaking, it is ſtrange that we ſhould be ſo amorous and careful of temporal things, that we cannot ſpare ſome time for ſpiritual things: we can find time to feed our bodies, for the moſt part with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and yet we cannot allow ſome time to feed our Souls.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Such is the Reverence which the Church bears to this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhe ordains this taking of Wine after the Communion of the Chalice, leſt any drops ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Chalice: as alſo to cleanſe it after the holy ſpecies.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> There is no neceſſity of both, either may ſuffice; but the Church uſes both, and not without Myſtery; for the Prieſt having received the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is to be waſhed with Water and Wine, that is, with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual exultation and joy ſignified by the Wine, and compunction of our Saviours paſſion ſignified by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for this Sacrifice has a mixture of joy and ſorrow, of joy for the

Some have noted that in St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his time, the Prieſt did ſay <hi>Simeons</hi> Canticle: <hi>Now thou doeſt diſmiſs thy ſervant, O Lord, according to thy word in peace: becauſe mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all People; a light to the Revelation of the Gentils, and the glory of thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Iſrael, which is very proper for this place, and may be ſaid with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion by all preſent, eſpecially by thoſe who have received the holy <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>

The <hi>Arabick</hi> Text ſayes, <hi>They give praiſe to God,</hi> for this Hymn was of Thankſgiving and praiſe to God.

                  </p>
                  <p>Myſtically as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. ſayes, it is a Symbole of joy, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Apoſtles joy in ſeeing Chriſts Reſurrection: The Text ſays, <hi>They were glad when they ſaw our Lord:</hi> It may alſo be ſaid, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the joy of our holy Mother the Church, in ſeeing her children fed with the Fleſh and blood of her Spouſe Chriſt Jeſus, whereby their pious deſires are ſatisfied, and they nouriſhed with that celeſtial Viand, which will bring them to the celeſtial joyes.</p>
                  <p>We may imitate the Apoſtles in their joy for Chriſts Reſurrection, for if they were glad to ſee Jeſus, and the <hi>Bethlemites</hi> when they ſaw the Ark; we have ſeen in this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

                  <p>Q. <hi>Why does the Prieſt ſay this at the right end of the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Miſſal is brought to that ſide, to end the <hi>Maſſe</hi> where it was begun; and as before the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, the Miſſal was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence, to ſhew the Apoſtles going to preach Gods word to the Gentils, forſaking the <hi>Jews</hi> who were obſtinate and rejected Chriſts Law: So now in the end of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> the Miſſal is brought back again, to intimate unto us, that in the end of the World, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall receive true faith, and be united to Chriſts Flock.</p>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:33751:211"/>
                  <p>In this Ceremony therefore the Church repreſents the infinite mercy of God, who notwithſtanding the <hi>Jews</hi> great malice, obdurateneſs, and hardneſs of heart, never ceaſeth by his Miniſters, to call them, and to ſhew the immenſity of his goodneſs and clemency before the day of judgment, by a miraculous hand, as by force he will convert them.

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Prieſt being here to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us a new Myſtery of the Aſcention, in imitation of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:33751:214"/>who at his Aſcention appearing to his Diſciples, as St. <hi>John</hi> teſtifies, redoubled his Heavenly ſalutation of <hi>Pax vobis,</hi> Peace be to you: reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates alſo his <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> our Lord be with you, to comfort us, and to aſſure us that our Lord is with us according to his promiſe; <hi>Behold</hi> ſayes he, <hi>I am with you all dayes, even to the conſummation of the World;</hi> which may be a comfort to us, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the faithful in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; for as St. <hi>Proſper</hi> gloſſes upon the foreſaid words: <hi>It is all one, and to ſay fear ye not your infirmity, but truſt in my power, for I will not leave you in this work; not that ye may not ſuffer any thing, but I am ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form much more, that ye be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by any cruelty of the perſecutors;</hi> we are in the midſt of perſecutions, tribulations and afflictions, all which ought not to terrifie or frighten us, becauſe we have this Buckler ſtill to defend our ſelves, Our Lord is with us, for he ſayes I am with you: and by the Prophet <hi>David</hi> aſſures us the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:33751:214"/>ſame, I am with him in Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the Prieſt in this part of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> kiſſes the Altar, then turns and ſalutes the people, twice in token of the double peace which is given us by vertue of this holy Sacrifice and Sacrament, to wit, the peace of our minds in this World, and the peace of eternity which is here promiſed in Chriſts Aſcention.</p>

                  <head>3. Of the Concluſion of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Concluſion of the</hi> Maſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church uſes three ſeveral Concluſions of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> The firſt is <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> Go or depart, <hi>Maſſe</hi> is done: to ſignifie that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is offered up, bearing with it the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of Chriſts paſſion, preſented for us to God the Father; or that the holy Hoſt carrying with it a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Paſs-port of our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is received in Heaven, or the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:33751:215"/>
                     <hi>Maſſe</hi> is accompliſhed, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for us is finiſhed, or that the Sacrifice is ſent us to appeaſe Gods wrath from us.</p>
                  <p>By others, whether this <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> ſerves as a leave or permiſſion to the people, to retire or depart from the Church, <hi>Maſſe</hi> being accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So our Saviour after he had fed the multitude with Seven Loaves diſmiſſed them, and diſmiſſing them gave them leave to return to their houſes. Or we take this <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> as he ſhould ſay, go after Chriſt and follow, for we muſt not ſtand in this World, but haſten to our Countrey by good works, which we may the more eaſily do; becauſe the Hoſt is ſent up or tranſmitted to pleaſe God the Father, by his Son Chriſt Jeſus; by which Hell and all the force thereof is overcome, and the entry of Paradiſe opened. <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> deduces this Rite from the words of our Saviour, Riſe let us go: as if the Prieſt ſhould ſay, <hi>Maſſe</hi> is done, go man and fructifie, ſhew in your
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:33751:215"/>actions what you have promiſed in your Oriſons; you have received the pledge of eternity, ſo walk, that you may come to it.</p>
                  <p>Some very impertinently would have the cuſtome of ſaying <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> to have been uſed in the diſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> for although that after the Goſpel, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, becauſe they were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be preſent at the holy Myſteries, as is to be ſeen in St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and in the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council, yet in no place do we find this manner of ſalutation unto them. Only in the Liturgie of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> there is a command given, that they ſhould withdraw or go forth, <hi>Diſcedite Catechumeni.</hi> But this <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> was alwayes ſaid in the end of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> only to the faithful Chriſtians, after they had been partakers of the Myſteries. It is true that as St. <hi>Clement</hi> teaches, ſometimes the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>Ite in pace,</hi> Go in peace; which words Chriſt did frequently uſe after ſome of his
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:33751:216"/>miraculous Works, and imports as much as the God of peace be with you all: not much differing in ſence from the <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> for the peace which that preſents, is that which is to be obtained by the <hi>Maſſe;</hi> So that in ſaying it, the Prieſt aſſures us, that peace is imparted unto us by the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may piouſly meditate that at Chriſts Aſcention, the Diſciples were Devoutly kneeling, praying, and adoring our Saviour, until ſuch time as the Angels did cry out unto them, <hi>Ye men of</hi> Galilee, <hi>why ſtand you look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Heaven? this Jeſus who is aſſumpted from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come as you have ſeen going into Heaven,</hi> as if they ſhould ſay go, and ſo lead your lives that ye may come to that glory, which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us in Chriſts Aſcention, and let us Devoutly anſwer the Prieſt, by ſaying, <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> imitating the Apoſtles, who as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes, <hi>adoring went back into</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>with great joy,</hi> and they were alwayes
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:33751:216"/>in the Temple praiſing and bleſſing God, which is conformable to this part of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which as is ſaid before ought to be of praiſe, and thanksgiving; whence in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-time the Church adds Alleluja, as a Canticle of joy and praiſe; joy in our Souls, and peace to God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the ſecond Concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Sometimes the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the <hi>Maſs</hi> with <hi>Benedicamus Domino,</hi> which ſhe uſes in all peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential times, as in <hi>Advent, Lent:</hi> The <hi>Ember</hi> days, and <hi>Vigils:</hi> as alſo in the Ferial days out of <hi>Eaſter</hi> time; in which times as ſhe omits the <hi>Gloria in excelſis,</hi> which is a Hymn of joy; ſo ſhe omits the <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> and in its place ſays, <hi>Benedicamus Domino,</hi> Let us bleſs our Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Durand</hi> gives a plauſible reaſon for it, ſaying, that in the primitive Church, when there was any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Congregation; the Prieſts were wont to conclude with <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> but when there were but a few, or none of the faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:33751:217"/>with <hi>Benedicamas Domino,</hi> and conſequently to this when he ſays, <hi>Ite,</hi> He remains turned to the people after <hi>Dominus vobiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum:</hi> but when he ſays <hi>Benedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> he turns to the Altar; it is not incongruouſly ſaid, that <hi>Ite miſſa eſt</hi> is uſed in times of joy, in which the people are diſmiſſed, but in thoſe primitive times they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to prayer for remiſſion of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third Concluſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That which is only uſed in <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the dead, when inſtead of the other, there is ſaid <hi>Requieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in peace,</hi> Let them reſt in peace, which is ſuitable to the whole courſe of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> wherein is no ſpecial prayer for the living; but what is then ſaid to the living, is only to incite them to pray for the dead, as the Prieſt does all along; and conſequently ſtanding near to the Altar, in the end he ſalutes not the people, but prays for the dead, and ſo paſſes on without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:33751:217"/>any Benediction, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he does, becauſe the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not given, but to them, that are preſent, whoſe part is only to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> as devoutly joyning with the Prieſt.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="subsection">
                  <head>3. Of the Prieſt's Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</head>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What Prayer is that which the Prieſt then makes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He prays that his ſervice or Sacrifice, not done by preſumption, but in Obedience to Chriſt and his Church, may be pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Divine Majeſty, as well for himſelf, as for all thoſe, for whom he has offered it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have a reſemblance in <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying to <hi>Aaron, Approach to the Altar and immolate for thy ſin, offer the Holocauſt, and pray for thy ſelf and for the People: and when thou haſt ſlain the Peoples Hoſt, pray for them as our Lord hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:33751:218"/>
                  <p>This prayer being made, the Prieſt kiſſeth the Altar, as in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Sacrifice being accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God; he turns to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſaying, <hi>The Omnipotent God, Father and Son, and holy Ghoſt bleſs you,</hi> Amen. Making the ſign of the Croſs on all who are preſent where we may note that as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly has been declared, the Church in all Sacraments and Benedictions invocates the bleſſed Trinity, and that as the <hi>Maſs</hi> begins with the invocation of the holy Trinity, ſo it ends.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whence comes the uſe of this Benediction?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church has taken it from the Law of Nature, <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, and from the Law of grace. In the Law of Nature <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> after he had offered his Sacrifice of Bread and Wine, a true figure of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the firſt part, he bleſſed <hi>Abraham. Jacob</hi> alſo bleſſed <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Children, and particularly at the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:33751:218"/>time of his death; and when God taught <hi>Moſes</hi> the manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration and Oblation, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined a ſet form of bleſſing the people, <hi>Our Lord bleſs thee and keep thee: Our Lord ſhew his face to thee, and have mercy on thee: our Lord turn his countenance unto thee, and give thee Peace:</hi> Where we may note, that the form of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is virtually the ſame; for in that form there is thrice our Lord; preſenting the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, and they are but a more ample Declaration of Gods bleſſings which is ſufficiently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in what the Prieſt ſays, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God, who can by his power give all good gifts bleſs you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rabanus</hi> makes this application of it, Our Lord God the Father, bleſs thee, and keep thee by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency: Our Lord God the Son ſhew his face to thee by his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and have mercy on thee by his paſſion. Our Lord God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt turn his countenance unto
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:33751:219"/>thee by his gracious inſpirations, and give thee peace by the infuſion of his grace. It has been alſo uſed in Chriſt's Church even from the beginning, as is to be ſeen in all antient Liturgies. The <hi>Grecians</hi> who uſe St. <hi>Baſils,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes</hi> Liturgies, have it to this day; for the Prieſt turning about to the people, ſays, Our Lord keep ye all in his grace and goodneſs perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, now, always, and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the principal motive of the Benediction in this place, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent more compleatly the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of our Saviour, of whom it is ſaid, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates, <hi>Chriſt brought them forth abroad into</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thania, <hi>and lifting his hands he bleſſed them; and it came to paſs that whilſt he bleſſed them, he departed from them, and was carried into Heaven:</hi> from whence as <hi>Amalarius</hi> and others note, comes the Tradition of the Catholick Church, that the Prieſt in the perſon of Chriſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:33751:219"/>accompliſhed and diſtributed the B. Sacrifice, bleſles the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Durand</hi> agrees in this, and adds alſo that this Benediction may well repreſent the coming of the holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt had promiſed; this ſignification is not unproper, for what is Benediction, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the holy Ghoſt in the effects of grace? which <hi>Innocent</hi> 3d. confirms, ſaying, that this Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſignifies the deſcent of the holy Ghoſt, and is no other than a ſealing and confirming of the effects of this Sacrifice, by which the holy Ghoſt comes to our Souls accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt's promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But why does the Prieſt lift up his hand over the People, and ſign them with the Croſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This rite may be ſaid to be taken from the cuſtom of the Prieſts in the old Law: for <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtretching forth his hand to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and bleſſed them; <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed <hi>Joſephs</hi> Children and did the ſame; nay, he laid his hands croſs-wiſe on
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:33751:220"/>them; Our Saviour in his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did the ſame, as is even now ſaid. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> with <hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Suares,</hi> do conceive that our Saviour did then make the ſign of the Croſs, which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> confirms out of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> I will put a ſign in them: thus ſays he, Chriſt aſcending to his Father left us, and placed it on our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, that we might freely ſay, the light of thy countenance O Lord, is ſigned upon us.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is this Benediction the greater, by being given by a holy perſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I cannot ſay, but that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, the ſanctity of the bleſſer may add ſomething to the encreaſe of the effects, following ſuch Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; eſpecially if they be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, independently of any order or function; for if they be publick, or done according to the rites and forms of the Church, by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and publick perſons, as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally here in the <hi>Maſs,</hi> little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had, either of their
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:33751:220"/>Sanctity or otherwiſe: for ſuch bleſſing comes not from him, as a private perſon, but a publick: in the name of the Church, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God himſelf; who has made that hand ſo powerful, as to Conſecrate, handle, and take the body and blood of Chriſt Jeſus, and who has promiſed to ſecond the Prieſt's Benediction, according to that <hi>They,</hi> that is, the Prieſt, ſhall invocate my name upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that is, bleſs them according to the form which God had given them, and I will bleſs them: where God promiſes to bloſs them whom they ſhall bleſs. Whence St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> adviſes us not to regard, if perhaps he that gives it be negligent, or cares not what he does, but behold our Lord who ſends it.</p>
                  <p>We ought therefore to recive the Prieſt's Benediction with all Humility and Devotion. In St. <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Liturgie it is ſaid, that all the people bowing down their
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:33751:221"/>heads, were wont to ſay: <hi>Our Lord conſerve for many years him, who bleſſes and ſanctifies us;</hi> in which words they expreſs the great eſteem they had of this bleſſing, and their gratitude to the Prieſt who bleſſes them. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> declares the ſame, ſaying, <hi>ye ought to humble your ſelves at the Benediction, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully incline your hearts and bodies, for this Benediction, although it be given by man; yet not from man: the bleſſings we expect is from God, and therefore we ought to expect</hi> it with all Devotion and Humility.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Ought we to make the ſign of the Croſs upon our ſelves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. I</hi> ſee it done very frequently; Now although the ſigning of our ſelves with the Croſs at all times is good, yet at this time: as alſo when the Benediction of the holy Sacrament is given, it ſeems not ſo convenient: for in theſe we ought rather to attend to the Prieſts Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, and ſigning, as an Act of Authority and power in the perſon of God, which is far more to be
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:33751:221"/>eſteemed then our own private Action; our beſt diſpoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to receive it, is paſſively with Humility of mind, and proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or bowing of the body and joyned hands</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we may conſider, that the Prieſt here in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the perſon of Chriſt in his Aſcenſion, and bleſſing his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in whoſe name and power he Communicates unto us, the ſelf-ſame bleſſing; let us therefore as in Spirit and Devotion, we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed in this holy Sacrifice, our ſweet Saviour in his Nativity, Life, Paſſion and Reſurrection; So let us follow him in his Aſcention, there humbly to receive his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and with the Diſciples adore him, praiſing and bleſſing God for ever.</p>

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:33751:223"/>two Goſpels on one day, one of the Feaſt, another of the time, the Church is wont to uſe a Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the one in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> which is then ſaid, and at the end thereof reads its Goſpel, as being the principal part of the Office, belonging to the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Now for Conformity ſake, or rather Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in times when ſuch double Goſpels do not occur, the Church has made choice of this Goſpel, which is the Goſpel of the Third <hi>Maſſe</hi> on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-day, as the fountain of all other Evangelical verities, ordaining it to be ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may add another reaſon from the frequent and devout cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Chriſtians, who get prieſts to ſay this Goſpel over them in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of infirmity, head-ach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To prevent or take away Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and to defend them from the Devil: we find alſo ſuch reading of the Goſpel over the ſick, and over poſſeſſed perſons, even in the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:33751:223"/>Church-Rituals, in the old <hi>Sarum Manual:</hi> on Children after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and in making holy water: all which uſe the Church approves, or at leaſt tollerates; from whence it may well come, that the Prieſts to ſatisfie their Devotion, did read this Goſpel over the people before they went from the Church. <hi>Harpſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in his Hiſtory, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. brings a wonderful Hiſtory to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What Ceremonies are uſed in ſaying this Goſpel?</hi>

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:33751:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>Creed. <hi>Et homo factus eſt,</hi> And he was made man; only in the end we ſay inſtead of <hi>Laus tibi Chriſte, Deo Gratias,</hi> Thanks be to God, as concluding the whole office with Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>We ought then to meditate on the Myſteries contained in this Sacred Goſpel, principally the Incarnation which is declared in thoſe ſweet words, <hi>The word was made fleſh.</hi> and when we hear it Solmnly pronounced, we ought to adore our Lord, in heart mind and love, and exteriourly expreſs it by bowed knees and bended heart, ſaying, <hi>Deo Gratias.</hi>
